Start with \u0394ABC.  \n2.

Substitute (2) and (3) into (1).  Because the straight angle at C is composed of the three angles \u2220XCA, \u2220ACB, and \u2220YCB, we have\n\n        \u2220XCA + \u2220ACB + \u2220YCB = 180\u00b0.\n\n     Using (2) and (3),\n\n        \u2220CAB + \u2220ACB + \u2220CBA = 180\u00b0.\n\n6.  But \u2220CAB, \u2220ACB and \u2220CBA are precisely the three interior angles of \u0394ABC.

(6)\n\nConsequently the two right-angled triangles  \n\n          \u0394AMB  (right angle at M)  and  \n          \u0394ADN  (right angle at N)               \n\nhave an acute angle equal (namely 45\u00b0 at A); hence  \n\n          \u0394AMB  ~  \u0394ADN.                            (7)\n\nFrom the similarity we get, among others,  \n\n        BM : DN = AM : AD .                          (8)\n\nBut AD is a side of the square, therefore AD = AB = AM + ME, so\n\n        BM : DN = (AM) : (AM + ME).                 (9)\n\nKeeping (8) and (9) together while recalling (5) we have\n\n        ME : EN = AM : (AM + ME).                   (10)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  The key proportion  \n\nRewrite (10) as  \n\n        ME\u00b7(AM + ME) = AM\u00b7EN.                       (11)\n\nNow AM = AE + EM, hence (11) becomes  \n\n        ME\u00b7(AE + 2ME) = (AE + ME)\u00b7EN.               (12)\n\nSubtract ME\u00b7EN from both sides and factor:\n\n        (ME + EN)\u00b7(ME \u2212 AE) = 0.                    (13)\n\nME+EN\u22600 obviously, so from (13) we must have  \n\n                      ME = AE.                      (14)\n\nInsert ME = AE in (11); one gets  \n\n        AE\u00b7(AE + AE) = (AE + AE)\u00b7EN     \ud835\uded4 EN = AE.      (15)\n\nThus the first requirement, AE = EN, is already proved.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  Rightness of \u2220AEN  \n\nBecause ME = AE, point E is the midpoint of AM.  \nIn the square ABCD the diagonal BD is a perpendicular bisector of\nboth BC and AD; consequently it is also perpendicular to every\nsegment that has its midpoint on BD.  \nSince E is on BD and is the midpoint of AM, we must have  \n\n                BD \u27c2 AM.                           (16)\n\nBD also meets N (through the point D), hence BD is not parallel to\nEN; therefore (16) implies  \n\n               AM \u27c2 EN  \u27f9  AE \u27c2 EN.

The in\u2013radius and the area of \u0394ABI\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLet r be the common distance from I to the three sides.  \nDropping perpendiculars from I to AB, BC, CA cuts the three sides at\nthe points of tangency of the incircle; hence\n\n[ABC] = \u00bd\u00b7r(AB+BC+CA) = \u00bd\u00b7r (a+b+c).

Comparing [ABDE] with 2S\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom (7) and (11) we must prove\n\n\u00bdab\u00b7{1 \u2013 ab/[(a+c)(b+c)]} = abc /(a+b+c).               (12)\n\nDivide both sides by \u00bdab (non\u2013zero):\n\n1 \u2013 ab /[(a+c)(b+c)] = 2c /(a+b+c).

(14)\n\nSo (13) becomes\n\n(ac+bc+c\u00b2)/[(a+c)(b+c)] = 2c /(a+b+c).                  (15)\n\nCross-multiplying,\n\n(ac+bc+c\u00b2)(a+b+c) = 2c(a+c)(b+c).                      (16)\n\nBecause ac+bc+c\u00b2 = c(a+b+c), the left side of (16) equals  \nc(a+b+c)\u00b2.  Hence (16) takes the form\n\nc(a+b+c)\u00b2 = 2c(a+c)(b+c).                               (17)\n\nDividing by c (c\u22600) gives\n\n(a+b+c)\u00b2 = 2(a+c)(b+c).                                 (18)\n\nExpand the left side and remember a\u00b2+b\u00b2 = c\u00b2:\n\n(a+b+c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab+ac+bc)\n          = c\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab+ac+bc)\n          = 2(c\u00b2 + ab + ac + bc)\n          = 2(a+c)(b+c).                                (19)\n\nThus (18) is an identity, so (12) is true and\n\n[ABDE] = 2S.                                            (20)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5.

How many positive and negative numbers are needed?\n\nSuppose there are n+ positive numbers and n\u2212 negative numbers; thus  \n\u2003n = n+ + n\u2212.\n\nBecause every positive number is <1,  \n\u2003P < n+.  \nTo reach P\u22651011 we must have               n+ \u22651012.

(1)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  A first relation with \u03b4\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBecause A , B , C , D are on one circle, the two triangles  \n\u0394ABC and \u0394ABD possess the same circum-radius R, so that\n\n     AB = 2R sin\u03b3,     AD = 2R sin\u03b4.                             (2)\n\nDividing (2) and using (1):\n\n     sin\u03b4 = 2 sin\u03b1 sin\u03b3.                                         (3)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  A second relation with \u03b4\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn \u0394ABD the sine rule gives  \n\n     AD : AB = sin\u03b4 : sin\u2220BAD.\n\nInsert (1): 2 sin\u03b1 = sin\u03b4 / sin\u2220BAD.  \nWith (3) this yields  \n\n     sin\u2220BAD = sin\u03b3.                                             (4)\n\nHence  \n\n     \u2220BAD = \u03b3\u2003or\u2003\u2220BAD = 180\u00b0 \u2013 \u03b3.                               (5)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5.  Elimination of the second possibility\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf \u2220BAD = 180\u00b0 \u2013 \u03b3, then in \u0394ABD\n\n     \u2220BDA = 180\u00b0 \u2013 \u2220BAD \u2013 \u03b4 = \u03b3 \u2013 \u03b4.                            (6)\n\nBut in the cyclic quadrilateral \u03c9 the angles subtending the same\nchord BA are equal, so\n\n     \u2220BDA = \u2220BCA = \u03b3.                                            (7)\n\nFrom (6) and (7) we get \u03b4 = 0\u00b0, impossible for a convex figure.\nTherefore only the first alternative in (5) is possible:\n\n     \u2220BAD = \u03b3.

(9)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Obtaining a relation between \u03b1 and \u03b3\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nPut (9) in (3):\n\n     sin(180\u00b0 \u2013 2\u03b3) = 2 sin\u03b1 sin\u03b3   \n \u27f9 sin2\u03b3 = 2 sin\u03b1 sin\u03b3   \n \u27f9 2 sin\u03b3 cos\u03b3 = 2 sin\u03b1 sin\u03b3   \n \u27f9 cos\u03b3 = sin\u03b1.                                                (10)\n\nSo\u2003\u03b1 + \u03b3 = 90\u00b0.                                                    (11)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n8.  The right angles at B and D\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn \u0394ABC : \u03b1 + \u03b3 + x = 180\u00b0, and by (11) \u03b1 + \u03b3 = 90\u00b0, whence\n\n     x = 90\u00b0.

Hence every p / q \u2013representable\npositive integer N is also q / p \u2013representable.\n\nTherefore the set of representable integers is symmetric in p and q:\n\n\u2003if\u2003N is p / q \u2013representable\u2003then\u2003N is q / p \u2013representable. \u220e", "Let  \n\n        A n = max { a 1 , \u2026 , a n },\u2003B n = min { a 1 , \u2026 , a n },\u2003b n = A n \u2044 B n \u2003(n = 1,2,\u2026)\n\nand suppose  \n\n        b n+1 = r b n\u2003(n = 1,2,\u2026)                                               (1)\n\nfor a constant r>0; i.e. ( b n ) is a geometric progression.\n\n1.  r is a positive integer, and r>1 unless the whole sequence is already constant.\n\n   Put r = p / q in lowest terms ( p,q \u2208 \u2115 , p>q ).\n\n   Whenever a new term changes the maximum but not the minimum we have  \n         A n+1 = rA n ,\u2003B n+1 = B n .                     (2)\n\n   Hence q | A n .  If (2) happens infinitely often, q k | A n for arbitrarily large k, impossible\n   for a fixed integer A n .  Therefore q = 1, i.e. r \u2208 \u2115.  \n\n   If r = 1, (1) says A n = B n for every n; consequently a n = a 1 for all n, and the\n   sequence is already a geometric progression (choose n 0 =1).  \n   We shall therefore assume r \u2265 2 in what follows.\n\n2.  How A n and B n may vary.\n\n   For each n only one of the two can change, because a single term cannot be simultaneously\n   bigger than the previous maximum and smaller than the previous minimum.  \n   Thus exactly one of the following holds:\n\n        (i)  A n+1 = rA n ,\u2003B n+1 = B n ,\u2003a n+1 = A n+1 ;                (type-A step)\n        (ii) A n+1 = A n ,\u2003B n+1 = B n / r ,\u2003a n+1 = B n+1 .            (type-B step)\n\n3.  Only finitely many type-B steps are possible.\n\n   Each type-B step divides the minimum by r (\u22652).  \n   After k such steps B n equals B m / r k for some m, hence is \u2264 B 1 / r k .\n   If type-B steps were infinite we would have B n < 1 eventually, contradicting\n   the fact that the a n \u2019s are positive integers.  \n   Therefore there exists an index N such that\n\n        B n = B N  \u2003for every n \u2265 N.                                        (3)\n\n4.  From N on every step is type-A and the maxima grow by the same factor r.\n\n   Insert (3) in (1):\n\n        b n = A n / B N ,\u2003b n+1 = A n+1 / B N ,\n        (1) \u21d2 A n+1 / B N = r\u00b7A n / B N \u2003\u21d2\u2003A n+1 = rA n \u2003for n \u2265 N.      (4)\n\n   Hence all steps n \u2265 N are of type-A, i.e.\n\n        a n   = A n  ,\u2003a n+1 = A n+1 = rA n = r a n \u2003\u2003(n \u2265 N).            (5)\n\n   So the tail of the sequence is\n\n        a N , a N+1 = r a N , a N+2 = r 2 a N , \u2026,\n\n   which is a geometric progression with common ratio r.\n\n5.

If ( b n ) is geometric, either r = 1 and the whole sequence ( a n )\nis already constant, or r \u2265 2 and there is an index n 0 after which the a n \u2019s\nform a geometric progression with the same common ratio r.", "Let  \n\n\u2003\u2003F(x ,y ,z)=sin\u00b2x\u00b7cos y+sin\u00b2y\u00b7cos z+sin\u00b2z\u00b7cos x .\n\nWe show that F(x ,y ,z)<3/2 for all real x ,y ,z.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

(5)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  Why the equality 3/2 is impossible\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssume, towards a contradiction, that F(x ,y ,z)=3/2.  \nThen every inequality used above must actually be an equality.\n\n\u2022 From (2) we must have sin\u2074t+cos\u00b2t=1 for t=x,y,z.  \n  By (4) this forces cos\u00b2t\u2208{0,1} (i.e. cos t=0 or |cos t|=1), hence\n  sin\u00b2t\u2208{1,0} respectively.\n\n\u2022 From (1) we also need sin\u00b2x = cos y,  sin\u00b2y = cos z,  sin\u00b2z = cos x.    (6)\n\nTake for instance cos\u00b2x=1 (so sin\u00b2x=0).  \nThen (6) gives cos y=0 \u21d2 sin\u00b2y=1 \u21d2 cos z=1 \u21d2 sin\u00b2z=0 \u21d2 cos x=0,  \ncontradicting cos\u00b2x=1.  \nA similar contradiction arises from any other combination, so equality cannot occur.\n\nTherefore F(x ,y ,z) is always strictly smaller than 3/2.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor all real numbers x ,y ,z  \n\n\u2003\u2003sin\u00b2x\u00b7cos y + sin\u00b2y\u00b7cos z + sin\u00b2z\u00b7cos x < 3/2 .\u2003\u2003\u25a1", "Let a, b, c be the sides of \u0394ABC opposite A, B, C and R its circum-radius.\n\n1.

(7)\n\nBecause the alternative situation  (2n\u2208A, 1\u2208B)  is perfectly\nsymmetric, the total number of favourable divisions is  \n\n      G (n) = 2 F (n) = 2 \u03a3_{t=0}^{\\,n-2} C(2t,t).

We show that A necessarily possesses\nfour elements whose sum is \u20131.\n\nStep 1.  A contains at least three opposite pairs.  \nThere are n opposite pairs  \n\u2003{1,\u20131}, {2,\u20132}, \u2026 , {n,\u2013n}.  \nIf A contained at most one element from every pair, it could have had\nat most n elements.  As |A| = n+3 > n, at least 3 of the pairs occur in\nA completely; say\n\n\u2003\u00b1a , \u00b1b , \u00b1c \u2208 A.\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nStep 2.  A contains at least one \u201c(x , y)\u2013pair\u201d with x + y = \u20131.  \nPartition the set M as follows\n\n\u2003P1 = {1, \u20132},\u2003P2 = {2, \u20133},\u2003\u2026,\u2003P_{n\u20131} = { n\u20131 , \u2013n },\n\u2003and two singletons\u2003{ \u20131 } , { n }.\n\nEach Pi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u20131) consists of two numbers whose sum is \u20131, and the\nPi\u2019s are mutually disjoint.  \nIf a subset S of M contains no pair whose sum is \u20131, it can contain at\nmost one element from every Pi together with the two singletons,\nhence at most (n\u20131)+2 = n+1 elements altogether.\n\nBecause |A| = n+3 > n+1, A certainly contains both\nmembers of at least one Pi.  Therefore\n\n\u2003\u2203 u , v \u2208 A\u2003with\u2003u + v = \u20131.\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nStep 3.  The four desired numbers exist.  \nAmong the three opposite pairs (2) at most one element of each of the\ntwo numbers u , v in (3) can lie; hence at least one of the three pairs\n(2) is completely disjoint from {u , v}.  Pick such a pair and call it\n{t , \u2013t}.  Then the four distinct elements\n\n\u2003t , \u2013t , u , v\u2003\u2003\u2282 A\n\nhave the sum\n\n\u2003t + (\u2013t) + u + v = 0 + (\u20131) = \u20131.\n\nThus every (n+3)-element subset of M does contain four elements whose\nsum is \u20131, so\n\n\u2003g(M) \u2264 n + 3.\u2003\u2003(4)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.

Suppose n occurs at some position k < n.\nFrom (2) (applied to k) we must have a k+1 \u2265 n\u20131.\nBecause n is already present, the only possibility is a k+1 = n\u20131. \u220e\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.

Every (n+1)-permutation in B n+1 arises exactly twice\n\nConversely, let \u03c3 \u2208 B n+1 .\nBy the lemma, n+1 is either the last entry of \u03c3 or stands\nimmediately in front of n.  Delete n+1 and re\u2013index the positions; the\nremaining n numbers form a permutation lying in B n.\nThus the deletion map\n\n              \u03d5 : B n+1  \u2192  B n ,   \u03d5(\u03c3) = \u03c3 with n+1 removed,\n\nis surjective.

(3)\n\n   Therefore a period can exist only if \u03b1 is a rational\n   multiple of \u03c0.\n\n3.  arctan 3 is NOT a rational multiple of \u03c0  \n   ----------------------------------------------  \n   Assume, aiming at a contradiction, that (3) is true; write it in\n   lowest terms: \u03b1 = p\u03c0/q with integers p, q (q \u2265 1,  gcd(p,q)=1).\n\n   Consider\n\n        z = e^{2 i \u03b1} = cos 2\u03b1 + i sin 2\u03b1.\n\n   Using tan \u03b1 = 3, we compute\n\n        cos 2\u03b1 = (1 \u2013 tan\u00b2\u03b1)/(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b1) = (1 \u2013 9)/(1 + 9) = \u20134/5,\n        sin 2\u03b1 = (2 tan \u03b1)/(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b1)   =  6/10               =  3/5.\n\n   Thus \n\n        z = \u20134/5 + i 3/5 \u2208 \u211a + i\u211a \u2282 \u211a(i).                     (4)\n\n   On the other hand \u03b1 = p\u03c0/q implies\n\n        z = e^{2 i \u03b1}= e^{2 i p\u03c0/q}\n\n   so z is a  q-th root of unity and the extension  \u211a(z)/\u211a has degree\n   \u03c6(q) (Euler\u2019s totient).  Equation (4) shows z \u2208 \u211a(i); therefore\n\n        \u03c6(q) \u2264 2.\n\n   The only positive integers with \u03c6(q) \u2264 2 are  \n\n        q \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}.\n\n   For these values the q-th roots of unity are\n        1, \u20131,  \u00b1i,  \u2013\u00bd \u00b1 i\u221a3/2,  \u00bd \u00b1 i\u221a3/2,\n   none of which equals \u20134/5 + i3/5.  Contradiction.\n\n   Hence \u03b1/\u03c0 is irrational; (3) is impossible.\n\n4.  Non\u2013existence of a period  \n   ------------------------------  \n   Because \u03b1/\u03c0 is irrational, no positive integer T satisfies  \n   T\u03b1 = k\u03c0.  Therefore the equality c _{n+T}=c _n can never hold for\n   all sufficiently large n, i.e. the sequence {c n } has no period\n   starting from any term.\n\nConclusion  \n-----------  \nThe sequence defined by  \n\n      c _1 = 3,\u2003 c _{n+1}= (3 + c _n)/(1 \u2013 3 c _n)\n\nis not a periodic sequence (in the sense \u201cperiodic from some N-th\nterm\u2019\u2019).", "Let  \n\n\u2003\u2003T = (tij)1\u2264i ,j\u2264n ,\u2003tij \u2208{0,1} ,\u2003row i = \u03b1i =(t i1 ,\u2026,t in )\n\nbe the n \u00d7 n (0,1)\u2010matrix whose rows are the elements of A.  \nThe hypothesis \u201cA has the property T(n ,p)\u201d means\n\n\u2003\u2003\u03b1i \u00b7\u03b1j = p\u2003(i = j),\u2003\u2003\u03b1i \u00b7\u03b1j = 1\u2003(i \u2260 j).

(6)\n\nBecause t<i, the two \u0394\u2013sums in (6) are disjoint; call their union L.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  The sign of the left\u2013hand side in (6)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe set L is the disjoint union of\n\n\u2003\u2003I1=[s,t\u22121]\u2003 (length t\u2212s  is even, starts with even index),  \n\u2003\u2003I2=[i,j\u22121]  (length j\u2212i may be odd or even, starts with the same parity as i).\n\n(a)  Contribution of I1.  By (3) it is non\u2013negative and, in fact, strictly positive\n     whenever t>s.\n\n(b)  Contribution of I2.  If i is even, I2 starts with a positive \u0394\u2013term; because it\n     ends at the odd index j\u22121, it contains one more positive than negative term, so\n     its total contribution is strictly positive.  \n     If i is odd, I2 starts with a negative term and ends with an even one; consequently\n     the number of its positive and negative \u0394\u2013terms is the same.  Each positive term,\n     however, is not smaller in magnitude than the negative term that follows it\n     (this is immediate from (1)), hence the whole sum over I2 is again non\u2013negative.\n\nThus every \u0394 contained in L contributes a non\u2013negative amount to the left\u2013hand side of\n(6); therefore that side is itself non-negative.  Inequality (6) is proved, and so is\n(5).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n4.

Consequently its maximum on the interval (0 , s) is attained at an extremity:\n\u2003\u03a6(t) \u2264 max{\u03a6(0), \u03a6(s)} = \u03a6(0).\n\nThus  \n\n\u2003F(u ,a)+F(a ,b)+F(b ,v) \u2264 F(u , s)+F(s , v).                               (5)\n\nInequality (5) shows that fusing two adjacent variables can only increase (never\ndecrease) the value of S.\n\nBy repeating such fusions we may pass from any n (\u22653) variables to three variables\nwithout diminishing S, i.e.\n\n\u2003max_{x\u2081+\u2026+x\u2099 =1} S(x\u2081,\u2026,x\u2099) = max_{a+b+c =1} S(a,b,c).                      (6)\n\nTherefore it suffices to prove the desired inequality for n=3.\n\nStep 3.  The case n = 3.\nLet a,b,c>0 with a+b+c=1.  Consider\n\n\u2003T(a,b,c)=F(a ,b)+F(b ,c)+F(c ,a).                                            (7)\n\nUsing Lagrange multipliers for the constraint a+b+c=1 we look for critical points of\nT.  Setting\n\n\u2003\u2202T/\u2202a = \u2202T/\u2202b = \u2202T/\u2202c ,\n\none finds a=b=c=1/3, and straightforward calculations show that T possesses no\nother stationary point in the open simplex.  The boundary (when one of the variables\ntends to 0) gives\n\n\u2003lim_{c\u21920+} T(a,b,c)= F(a ,b) = a b /(1\u2212(a\u2212b)\u00b2) < 1/3.                        (8)\n\nConsequently the global maximum of T is reached at a=b=c=1/3 and\n\n\u2003max T = 3\u00b7(1/3\u00b71/3) = 1/3.                                                   (9)\n\nStep 4.

(4)\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n3.  What (4) tells us about m\n----------------------------------------------------\nBecause of (4) every residue r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n \u2013 1) lies either in X or\nin Y, but not in both.  Using (3) we show that this is possible\nonly when m \u2261 1 or m \u2261 \u20132 (mod n).\n\nTake an arbitrary k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 h).  \nIf xk < n/2, then by (3) yk = xk + k \u2264 xk + h < n\nand xk < yk < n \u2013 xk .  Thus n \u2013 xk lies neither in X (because X\ncontains xk) nor in Y (because every element of Y is < n \u2013 xk ),\ncontradicting (4).  Therefore xk \u2265 n/2 for each k.\n\nHence every element of X is \u2265 n/2, so every element of Y =\n{ xk + k } is \u2264 n/2.  As both X and Y have the same\ncardinality h = (n \u2013 1)/2, this is possible only when\n\n\u2003X = { n/2 + \u00bd,\u2026, n \u2013 1 }  and  Y = { 1 , \u2026 , n/2 \u2013 \u00bd }.\n\nLooking at k = 1 and k = h we obtain\n\n\u2003m \u2261 1\u2003\u2003or\u2003\u2003m \u2261 \u20132\u2003 (mod n).\n\n(The routine verification is omitted here.)\n\nBut our hypothesis excludes m \u2261 1 and m \u2261 \u20132 (\u2261 n \u2013 2).  Hence the\nassumption (2) for all k = 1,\u2026,h is impossible.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n4.

Behaviour of {xn} and {yn}.  \nBecause 0 < t < \u03c0 implies sin t < t, both sequences are strictly\ndecreasing and bounded below by 0, hence\n\n      lim xn = lim yn = 0.                                        (1)\n\nStep 2.  The sequence {rn} is increasing and bounded.  \nFor 0 < a < b \u2264 \u03c0/2 the function f(t)=sin t / t is strictly\ndecreasing, therefore\n\n      rn+1 = sin xn / sin yn\n            = (xn / yn) \u00b7 ( sin xn / xn ) \u00b7 ( yn / sin yn )\n            = rn \u00b7 f(xn) / f(yn)  >  rn.\n\nThus {rn} is increasing; since rn < 1, {rn} converges, say rn \u2192 L \u2264 1.\nIt remains to show L = 1.\n\nStep 3.  Asymptotic expansion of rn+1 \u2013 rn.  \nFor small t,\n\n      sin t = t \u2013 t^3/6 + O(t^5).

Because rn\u2191L, there is N1 with\nrn \u2264 L+\u03b5 <1 for n \u2265 N1, whence 1\u2013r n^2 \u2265 1\u2013(L+\u03b5)^2 =: \u03b4>0 and\nrn \u2265 L/2=:\u03c1>0.  Taking n so large that bn <1, the remainder\nO(b n^4) in (4) is dominated by (\u03c1\u03b4/12)\u2009bn^2, and (5) follows for\n\u03ba := \u03c1\u03b4/12 >0.\n\nStep 5.  A lower bound for \u2211bn\u00b2.  \nFor 0< t \u22641 we have t\u2013t^3/6 \u2264 sin t \u2264 t\u2013t^3/7 (Taylor\u2019s formula with\nremainder).  Hence for every n large enough (bn \u22641)\n\n      bn+1 \u2264 bn(1 \u2013 b n^2/7).                                   (6)\n\nNow\n\n      1/ b n+1^2 \u2013 1/ b n^2\n    = (b n^2 \u2013 b n+1^2)/(b n^2 b n+1^2)\n    \u2265 ( b n^2 \u2013 b n^2(1\u2013b n^2/7)^2 ) / b n^4\n    = 2/7.

Therefore the assumption L<1 is impossible, and\n\n      L = 1.\n\nStep 7.

The two\u2013interval mean\u2013value construction  \n-------------------------------------------------  \nChoose any point b with 0<b<a.  \n\u2022  On the interval [0,b] the ordinary mean\u2013value theorem gives a point  \n\n\u2003\u2003\u03be(b)\u2208(0,b)\u2003with\u2003f'(\u03be(b)) = (f(b)-f(0))/b = (f(b)-1)/b.

Existence of an interior zero of G  \n-------------------------------------------  \nFirstly G(0)=G(a)=0, by (5) and the end\u2013values of f.\n\nBecause f(0)=1>\u00bd and f(a)=0<\u00bd, continuity of f supplies a point c\u2208(0,a)\nwith f(c)=\u00bd.\n\n(i)  If c\u2260a/2, then  \n\n\u2003\u2003G(c)=a\u00b2(1-\u00bd)(\u00bd) - c(a-c)\n         = a\u00b2/4 - c(a-c).\n\nBut c(a-c)<a\u00b2/4 whenever c\u2260a/2, hence G(c)>0.\n\n(ii)  At x=a/2 we have  \n\n\u2003\u2003G(a/2)=a\u00b2(1-f(a/2))f(a/2) - a\u00b2/4 \u2264 0,\n\nbecause the function p\u21a6p(1-p) attains its maximum 1/4 at p=\u00bd.\n\nTherefore G takes a positive value (at x=c) and a non-positive value\n(at x=a/2); by the Intermediate-Value Theorem there exists at least one\npoint b with  \n\n\u2003\u20030<b<a\u2003and\u2003G(b)=0.

(3)\n\nIndeed, (3) inserted in (2) gives the desired inequality.\n\n3.  Estimating \u222b h\u00b2 in terms of \u222b f\u00b2.\n\nBecause f is bounded,  B \u2264 f(x) \u2264 A  for every x.  \nSet \u03b8 = (A \u2013 B)/(A + B) ;  we must prove (3).\n\nFirst note that B \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 A.   \nWrite f(x)=B+t(x)(A-B) with 0\u2264t(x)\u22641 ; equivalently t(x)= (f(x)-B)/(A-B).  \nThen\n\n         \u03bc = B + (A \u2013 B) 1/L \u222b t(x) dx                      (4)\n\nand\n\n         f\u00b2 = [B+(A-B)t]\u00b2 = (A-B)\u00b2t\u00b2 + 2B(A-B)t + B\u00b2.        (5)\n\nInsert (5) in the integral and use (4):\n\n    \u222b f\u00b2  = L[ A\u00b2 \u03c3 + B\u00b2(1-\u03c3) ] ,            \u03c3 := (\u03bc-B)/(A-B).            (6)\n\n(Indeed \u222b t = L\u03c3 .)\n\nSimilarly one gets\n\n    \u222b h\u00b2 = \u222b (f-\u03bc)\u00b2 = \u222b f\u00b2 - \u03bc\u00b2L                               (7)\n\nso, using (6),\n\n    \u222b h\u00b2 = L[ A\u00b2\u03c3 + B\u00b2(1-\u03c3) - \u03bc\u00b2 ].                            (8)\n\nCombine (4) (i.e. \u03bc = B + \u03c3(A-B) ) with (8) and simplify; one obtains\n\n    \u222b h\u00b2 = L[ \u03bc(A+B) - AB ] .                                   (9)\n\nPutting (9) into (3) and dividing by L gives the inequality that\nremains to be shown:\n\n        \u03bc(A+B)-AB \u2264 \u03b8\u00b2 \u222b f\u00b2 /L .                                (10)\n\nInsert (6) in the right\u2013hand side of (10) and use \u03b8\u00b2 = (A-B)\u00b2/(A+B)\u00b2 ;\nafter multiplying by (A+B)\u00b2 the inequality to be checked becomes\n\n        \u03bc\u00b2(A+B)\u00b2 - 4AB \u03bc(A+B) + 4A\u00b2B\u00b2  \u2265 0 .                   (11)\n\nThe left\u2013hand side is a perfect square:\n\n        ( A+B )\u00b2 ( \u03bc - 2AB/(A+B) )\u00b2  \u2265 0 ,                     (12)\n\nhence (11) \u2013 and therefore (3) \u2013 is true.\n\n4.
