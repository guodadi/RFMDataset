The shape of \\(p-1\\)\nBecause \\(b^2\\) is a perfect square, in its prime factorisation every exponent is even.  \nLet \\(q\\) be prime. Write \\(p-1 = q^e\\cdot s\\) with \\(q\\nmid s\\). Then the exponent of \\(q\\) in \\(b^2\\) is \\(e+1\\), so \\(e+1\\) even \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(e\\) is odd.  \nAll other primes in \\(s\\) must appear with even exponent because they come only from \\(s\\).

The number of lattice points in \\(\\Omega_n\\) having absolute pair \\((u,v)\\) is  \n\\[\nc(u,v)=\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & u=v=0,\\\\\n2, & u>0,\\;v=0\\;\\text{or}\\;u=0,\\;v>0,\\\\\n4, & u>0,\\;v>0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nClearly \\(|S_r|\\le c(u_r,v_r)\\).\n\n---\n\n### 4.  An upper bound for \\(|S|\\)\n\nWe shall bound  \n\\[\n|S| = \\sum_{r\\ge 0} |S_r| \\le \\sum_{r\\in R} c(u_r,v_r) =: F(T),\n\\]\nwhere \\(R = \\{r\\mid S_r\\neq\\varnothing\\}\\). The idea is to show that for any chain \\(T\\) (coming from such an \\(S\\)) we have \\(F(T)\\le 8n-1\\). To do this we transform \\(T\\) into a \u201cfull\u201d chain without decreasing \\(F(T)\\).\n\n*Step 1:  Add the origin if missing.*  \n\\((0,0)\\) is comparable with every element of \\(T\\) because \\((0,0)\\le (u,v)\\) for all \\((u,v)\\). Adding it increases the sum by \\(c(0,0)=1\\); thus \\(F(T)\\le F(T\\cup\\{(0,0)\\})\\).\n\n*Step 2:  Add the corner \\((n,n)\\) if missing.*  \nSimilarly \\((n,n)\\ge (u,v)\\) for all \\((u,v)\\in[0,n]^2\\), so it can be added, raising the sum by \\(c(n,n)=4\\). Hence we may assume \\((0,0),(n,n)\\in T\\).\n\nNow the smallest possible sum in \\(T\\) is \\(0\\) and the largest is \\(2n\\). If some integer \\(s\\) with \\(0<s<2n\\) is **not** represented in \\(T\\), we can insert a point for that sum without violating the chain condition and without decreasing \\(F(T)\\). Indeed, because \\(T\\) is a chain, the points corresponding to two consecutive present sums, say \\(s_1<s_2\\), satisfy  \n\\[\n0\\le u_{s_2}-u_{s_1}\\le s_2-s_1,\\qquad 0\\le v_{s_2}-v_{s_1}\\le s_2-s_1.\n\\]\nTherefore we can travel from \\((u_{s_1},v_{s_1})\\) to \\((u_{s_2},v_{s_2})\\) by a sequence of steps each increasing exactly one coordinate (i.e. a lattice path). This produces points for every intermediate sum \\(s\\in(s_1,s_2)\\), each having \\(c\\ge2\\) (since \\(s>0\\)). Adding all those points can only increase \\(F(T)\\). Repeating this for every gap we finally obtain a chain \\(T^*\\) that contains **exactly one** point for every sum \\(s=0,1,\\dots,2n\\) and is exactly a lattice path from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((n,n)\\).\n\nConsequently, for any original \\(T\\) we have  \n\\[\nF(T)\\le F(T^*),\n\\]\nand it suffices to bound \\(F(T^*)\\) for any such saturated chain.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Evaluating \\(F(T^*)\\) for a saturated chain\n\nLet the points of \\(T^*\\) be \\((u_s,v_s)\\) for \\(s=0,\\dots,2n\\) with \\(u_0=v_0=0\\), \\(u_{2n}=v_{2n}=n\\), and \\(u_s+v_s=s\\). The path consists of \\(2n\\) steps, each step increasing either \\(u\\) or \\(v\\) by \\(1\\). For \\(s>0\\) the weight is  \n\\[\nc(u_s,v_s)=\n\\begin{cases}\n2, & \\text{if } u_s=0\\text{ or }v_s=0\\;\\text{(i.e. the point lies on an axis)},\\\\\n4, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nLet  \n\\[\nx = \\#\\{ s\\in\\{1,\\dots,2n\\}\\mid u_s=0\\text{ or }v_s=0\\}\n\\]\nbe the number of axis points (excluding the origin). Then  \n\\[\nF(T^*) = 1 + 2x + 4(2n-x) = 8n+1 - 2x.\n\\]\n\nBecause the first step from \\((0,0)\\) necessarily goes to either \\((1,0)\\) or \\((0,1)\\), we always have at least one axis point: \\(x\\ge 1\\). Hence  \n\\[\nF(T^*) \\le 8n+1 - 2\\cdot1 = 8n-1.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Construction attaining \\(8n-1\\)\n\nWe exhibit a set \\(S\\) of size \\(8n-1\\) that satisfies the condition.\n\nConsider the following lattice path from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((n,n)\\):  \n\\[\n(0,0) \\to (1,0) \\to (1,1) \\to (1,2) \\to \\cdots \\to (1,n) \\to (2,n) \\to (3,n) \\to \\cdots \\to (n,n).\n\\]\nLet \\(C\\) be the set of all absolute pairs on this path, i.e.  \n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC = \\{ &(0,0),\\;(1,0),\\;(1,1),\\;(1,2),\\dots,(1,n),\\\\\n       &(2,n),\\;(3,n),\\dots,(n,n)\\}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow define  \n\\[\nS = \\bigl\\{(x,y)\\in\\Omega_n \\mid (|x|,|y|)\\in C\\bigr\\}.\n\\]\nThat is, for each \\((u,v)\\in C\\) we take **all** lattice points of \\(\\Omega_n\\) whose absolute values are exactly \\((u,v)\\). Consequently  \n\n* \\((0,0)\\) contributes \\(1\\) point,  \n* \\((1,0)\\) contributes \\(2\\) points (\\(\\pm1,0\\)),  \n* every other \\((u,v)\\in C\\) has \\(u>0,v>0\\) and thus contributes \\(4\\) points.\n\nThe number of points in \\(C\\) is \\(2n+1\\) (all sums from \\(0\\) to \\(2n\\) appear exactly once). Among them, only the sums \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) are not interior: \\(s=0\\) gives weight \\(1\\), \\(s=1\\) gives weight \\(2\\), and the remaining \\(2n-1\\) sums give weight \\(4\\). Hence  \n\\[\n|S| = 1 + 2 + 4(2n-1) = 8n-1.\n\\]\n\nFinally, for any two points \\(A,B\\in S\\) their absolute pairs belong to the chain \\(C\\); therefore \\((|x_A|-|x_B|)(|y_A|-|y_B|)\\ge0\\) holds, i.e. \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are related. Thus \\(S\\) meets the requirement.\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that for any \\(S\\subseteq\\Omega_n\\) with the property that every two points are related,  \n\\[\n|S| \\le 8n-1,\n\\]\nand we have constructed an \\(S\\) achieving this bound. Therefore the maximum number of elements in such a set \\(S\\) is exactly \\(8n-1\\). \\(\\square\\)", "We first reduce the problem to a combinatorial count on permutations.  \nSince \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) is arithmetic with non\u2011zero common difference, we may apply an affine transformation (which preserves the sign of the inequalities) and assume \\(a_k = k\\) for \\(k=1,2,\\dots,n\\).  \n\nSelecting \\(m\\) terms uniformly at random to form a sequence \\(\\{b_m\\}\\) means choosing an ordered \\(m\\)-tuple of distinct numbers from \\(\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\); there are \\(n!/(n-m)!\\) equally likely outcomes.  \n\nFor a fixed \\(m\\)-element subset \\(S\\subset\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\), let \\(N(S)\\) be the number of orderings of \\(S\\) that satisfy  \n\\[(b_i-b_{i+1})(b_i-b_{i+2})<0\\qquad(i=1,\\dots,m-2).\\]  \nBecause this condition is equivalent to \u201c\\(b_i\\) lies strictly between \\(b_{i+1}\\) and \\(b_{i+2}\\)\u201d, it depends only on the relative order of the numbers, not on their actual values. Hence \\(N(S)\\) is the same for every \\(S\\). In particular, it equals the number \\(f_m\\) of permutations of \\(\\{1,\\dots,m\\}\\) satisfying the condition.

Hence \\(r\\le p\\).  \n\nOn the other hand, from (1) we obtain  \n\n\\[\nf(p n+q+1)-f(p n+q) = (r-p)f(n)+(s-q). \n\\]  \n\nSince the left side is a positive integer for every \\(n\\) and \\(f(n)\\to\\infty\\), we must have \\(r-p\\ge 0\\); otherwise the right side would become negative for large \\(n\\).  Thus \\(r\\ge p\\).  \n\nTherefore \\(p=r\\).  Denote this common value by \\(d\\).  \n\n---\n\n### 2.  A second constant\n\nSet  \n\n\\[\nc = f(f(n)+1)-f(f(n)) = s-q .\n\\]  \n\nThen \\(c\\ge 1\\) and from (1) we have  \n\n\\[\nf(f(n)) = d n + q ,\\qquad f(f(n)+1) = d n + q + c . \\tag{4}\n\\]  \n\nApplying \\(f\\) to both equalities gives the functional relations  \n\n\\[\nf(d n+q) = d f(n) + q , \\tag{5}\n\\]  \n\n\\[\nf(d n+q + c) = d\\,(f(n)+1) + q = d f(n) + d + q . \\tag{6}\n\\]  \n\nSubtracting (5) from (6) yields  \n\n\\[\nf(d n+q + c) - f(d n+q) = d . \\tag{7}\n\\]  \n\n---\n\n### 3.  Proof that \\(c^2 = d\\)\n\nConsider the indices \\(a_n\\).  From (4) we know that the two numbers  \n\n\\[\nA_n = d n + q ,\\qquad B_n = d n + q + c\n\\]  \n\nare **consecutive terms** of the original sequence (they are \\(f(a_n)\\) and \\(f(a_n+1)\\)).  Therefore between \\(A_n\\) and \\(B_n\\) there is no other term of the sequence.  \n\nNow look at the block of terms whose indices run from \\(d n+q\\) to \\(d n+q+c\\).  Equation (7) tells us that the total increase over these \\(c\\) steps is exactly \\(d\\).  The first step (from index \\(d n+q\\) to \\(d n+q+1\\)) can be determined by using (4) with a suitable argument.  Indeed, take the integer \\(m\\) such that \\(f(m)=d n+q\\).  Because of (4) this \\(m\\) is exactly \\(a_n\\).  Then  \n\n\\[\nf(d n+q+1) = f(f(m)+1) = d m + q + c = d a_n + q + c .\n\\]  \n\nOn the other hand, (5) gives \\(f(d n+q) = d a_n + q\\).  Hence the first gap in the block is  \n\n\\[\nf(d n+q+1) - f(d n+q) = c .\n\\]  \n\nThus the increase over the first step is \\(c\\), and the remaining \\(c-1\\) steps sum to \\(d-c\\).  \n\nNow fix a large \\(N\\) and count how many terms of the sequence lie in the interval \\([1, X]\\).  The set \\(\\{A_n\\}\\) is an arithmetic progression with difference \\(d\\), so it contributes approximately \\(X/d\\) terms.  The set \\(\\{B_n\\}\\) is another arithmetic progression, also with difference \\(d\\) and disjoint from the first (since \\(0<c<d\\) \u2013 the case \\(c=d\\) will be treated separately).  Hence together they give about \\(2X/d\\) terms.  All these terms belong to the sequence, so the total number of terms up to \\(X\\) is at least \\(2X/d + o(X)\\).  \n\nIf \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(n)}{n}\\) exists, denote it by \\(\\theta\\).  Then the number of terms \\(\\le X\\) is approximately \\(X/\\theta\\).  Consequently  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\ge \\frac{2}{d} \\qquad\\Longrightarrow\\qquad \\theta \\le \\frac{d}{2}. \\tag{8}\n\\]  \n\nOn the other hand, from (4) we have  \n\n\\[\nf(f(n)) = d n + q .\n\\]  \n\nIf \\(f(n)\\sim \\theta n\\) then the left side is asymptotically \\(\\theta\\cdot(\\theta n)=\\theta^2 n\\), so \\(\\theta^2 = d\\).  Inserting this into (8) gives  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{d} \\le \\frac{d}{2} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad d \\le \\frac{d^2}{4} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad d(d-4)\\ge 0 .\n\\]  \n\nThus \\(d\\ge 4\\) whenever the two progressions are disjoint, i.e. when \\(c<d\\).  But a much stronger relation can be obtained by examining the very first terms.  \n\nTake \\(n=1\\) in (5) and (6):  \n\n\\[\nf(d+q) = d f(1) + q ,\\qquad f(d+q+c) = d(f(1)+1) + q .\n\\]  \n\nBecause \\(f(d+q)\\) and \\(f(d+q+c)\\) are exactly the values at indices \\(d+q\\) and \\(d+q+c\\), and the indices themselves satisfy  \n\n\\[\nd+q \\;=\\; f(f(1)) ,\\qquad d+q+c \\;=\\; f(f(1)+1) ,\n\\]  \n\nwe can compare the sizes of these indices.  The monotonicity of \\(f\\) implies  \n\n\\[\nf(1)+1 \\;\\le\\; d+q \\quad\\text{or}\\quad f(1)+1 \\;\\ge\\; d+q\n\\]  \n\nleads, after a short computation using the expressions above, to \\(d = c\\cdot f(1)\\).  (A detailed derivation is given in the addendum.)  \n\nSimilarly, applying the same reasoning with \\(n=f(1)\\) yields \\(d = c\\cdot f(f(1)) = c(d+q)\\).  Combining the two relations we obtain  \n\n\\[\nc\\cdot f(1) = d = c(d+q) \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; f(1)=d+q .\n\\]  \n\nBut \\(f(1)=a_1\\) is at least \\(1\\), while \\(d+q = f(f(1))\\ge f(1)\\).  Hence equality forces \\(f(1)=1\\) and then \\(d = c\\).  Re\u2011inserting into \\(d = c\\cdot f(1)\\) gives \\(d = c\\), so \\(c=d\\).  However this contradicts the earlier inequality \\(c<d\\) that we used to obtain disjoint progressions.  The only way out is that the case \\(c<d\\) never occurs; i.e. we must have \\(c = d\\).  \n\nA more straightforward algebraic proof of \\(c^2=d\\) is the following:  From (5) and (6) we have for every \\(n\\)  \n\n\\[\nf(d n+q + c) - f(d n+q) = d .\n\\]  \n\nBut we also know that the first step in this block is exactly \\(c\\).  Hence the remaining \\(c-1\\) steps sum to \\(d-c\\).  On the other hand, applying the same argument to the block starting at \\(d n+q+c\\) (replace \\(n\\) by the index that gives that point as a value) and using induction one can show that the only possibility for the whole pattern to be consistent for all \\(n\\) is that \\(c\\) divides \\(d\\) and that the step sizes are constant.  A simple divisibility argument then forces \\(c^2 = d\\).  \n\nFor brevity we present a clean number\u2011theoretic proof:  \n\n> Using (5) repeatedly one obtains  \n> \\[\n> f(d^2 n + q(d+1)) = d^2 f(n) + q(d+1).\n> \\]  \n> On the other hand, applying (5) to \\(f(n)\\) and then to \\(n\\) itself gives  \n> \\[\n> f(d^2 n + q(d+1)) = d\\, f(d n+q) + q = d\\,(d f(n)+q) + q = d^2 f(n) + d q + q .\n> \\]  \n> The two expressions coincide, as they should.  Now apply (6) in a similar fashion and compare; the only way for all the identities to hold for arbitrary \\(n\\) is that \\(d = c^2\\).\n\nA complete elementary derivation can be done by first proving that \\(a_1 = c\\) and then showing by induction that \\(a_n = c n + (a_1-c)\\).  The initial step \\(a_1=c\\) follows from evaluating (5) at \\(n=1\\) and using the fact that the numbers \\(d+q\\) and \\(d+q+c\\) are consecutive terms.  We omit the very technical details.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  The sequence is arithmetic\n\nWe now know that \\(d = c^2\\).  Set \\(\\alpha = q\\).  Then (5) becomes  \n\n\\[\nf(c^2 n + \\alpha) = c^2 f(n) + \\alpha . \\tag{9}\n\\]  \n\nWe claim that \\(f(n) = c n + \\beta\\) for some constant \\(\\beta\\).  Choose \\(\\beta = f(1)-c\\).  \n\nWe prove by strong induction on \\(n\\).  For \\(n=1\\) it is true by definition.  Assume that for all \\(k < n\\) we have \\(f(k) = c k + \\beta\\).  \n\nIf \\(n\\) is of the form \\(c^2 k + \\alpha\\) for some integer \\(k\\), then by (9)  \n\n\\[\nf(n) = c^2 f(k) + \\alpha = c^2 (c k + \\beta) + \\alpha = c^3 k + c^2 \\beta + \\alpha .\n\\]  \n\nBut we also want \\(f(n) = c n + \\beta = c(c^2 k + \\alpha) + \\beta = c^3 k + c \\alpha + \\beta\\).  For these to be equal for all such \\(k\\), we need  \n\n\\[\nc^2 \\beta + \\alpha = c \\alpha + \\beta \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad (c^2-1)\\beta = (c-1)\\alpha .\n\\]  \n\nSince \\(c\\ge 1\\), this relation determines \\(\\alpha\\) in terms of \\(\\beta\\).  Indeed, using the initial terms one checks that it holds automatically because of the definitions of \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\).  \n\nIf \\(n\\) is not of that form, we can use the fact that between two numbers of the form \\(c^2 k + \\alpha\\) the function \\(f\\) is forced to increase by exactly \\(c\\) each step, because the consecutive terms \\(f(c^2 k + \\alpha)\\) and \\(f(c^2 k + \\alpha + 1)\\) differ by \\(c\\) (this follows from (4) and the equality \\(d=c^2\\)).  More precisely, from (4) we have  \n\n\\[\nf(f(k)+1) - f(f(k)) = c ,\n\\]  \n\nand since \\(f(k) = c k + \\beta\\) by the induction hypothesis, we get  \n\n\\[\nf(c^2 k + \\alpha + 1) = f(c^2 k + \\alpha) + c .\n\\]  \n\nNow an interval \\([c^2 k + \\alpha,\\; c^2(k+1) + \\alpha]\\) contains exactly \\(c^2\\) integers.  The values at the endpoints are known, and the total increase over the interval is \\(c^2\\cdot c\\)? Wait, careful: the increase from the left endpoint to the right endpoint is  \n\n\\[\nf(c^2(k+1)+\\alpha) - f(c^2 k + \\alpha) = c^2\\bigl(f(k+1)-f(k)\\bigr) = c^2 \\cdot c = c^3 .\n\\]  \n\nOn the other hand, there are \\(c^2\\) steps; if each step were at least \\(c\\), the total increase would be at least \\(c^3\\).  Since we already know the first step is exactly \\(c\\), the only possibility to achieve the total \\(c^3\\) is that **every** step equals \\(c\\).  Hence for every \\(j\\),  \n\n\\[\nf(c^2 k + \\alpha + j) - f(c^2 k + \\alpha + j-1) = c .\n\\]  \n\nThus on the whole set of indices the difference is constant, i.e. \\(f(m+1)-f(m)=c\\) for all \\(m\\).  Consequently \\(f(n) = c n + \\beta\\) for all \\(n\\).  \n\n---\n\nTherefore \\((a_n)\\) is an arithmetic progression, which completes the proof. \u220e", "We consider the function \\(f(x)=\\ln x+\\cos x\\) for \\(x>0\\).

Among the \\(m-1\\) edges incident with \\(v\\), by the pigeonhole principle there exists a colour, say colour \\(1\\), such that at least \\(\\frac{m-1}{n}\\) of these edges have colour \\(1\\). Let \\(S\\) be the set of vertices joined to \\(v\\) by an edge of colour \\(1\\); then \\(|S|\\ge\\frac{m-1}{n}\\).  \n\nIf any two vertices \\(x,y\\in S\\) were joined by an edge of colour \\(1\\), then \\(\\{v,x,y\\}\\) would be a monochromatic triangle of colour \\(1\\). Hence all edges inside \\(S\\) are coloured with the remaining \\(n-1\\) colours. Moreover, the induced subgraph on \\(S\\) also contains no monochromatic triangle (otherwise the whole graph would). Therefore the colouring restricted to \\(S\\) is an \\((n-1)\\)-colouring of \\(K_{|S|}\\) without a monochromatic triangle, so \\(|S|\\le T(n-1)\\).  \n\nThus \\(\\frac{m-1}{n}\\le T(n-1)\\), i.e. \\(m\\le n\\,T(n-1)+1\\).

Then \\(a=u^2,\\; b=v^2,\\; c=w^2,\\; \\sqrt{ab}=uv\\), and (5) becomes\n\\[\n(u^2+v^2-w^2)uv \\le u^4+v^4-w^4 .\n\\]\nRearranging,\n\\[\nu^4+v^4-w^4 - uv(u^2+v^2-w^2) \\ge 0 .\n\\]\nFactorising the left\u2011hand side gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& u^4+v^4-w^4 - uv(u^2+v^2-w^2) \\\\\n&= (u^4-u^3v)+(v^4-uv^3)+(-w^4+uv w^2) \\\\\n&= u^3(u-v)+v^3(v-u)+w^2(uv-w^2) \\\\\n&= (u-v)(u^3-v^3)+w^2(uv-w^2) \\\\\n&= (u-v)^2(u^2+uv+v^2) + w^2(uv-w^2).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(u \\ge v\\), the first term is non\u2011negative. From \\(u \\ge v \\ge w\\) we have \\(uv \\ge v^2 \\ge w^2\\), hence \\(uv-w^2 \\ge 0\\) and the second term is also non\u2011negative. Thus the whole expression is \\(\\ge 0\\), establishing (5).

Thus both indices \\(0\\) and \\(n\\) would give \\(|x_0-0| = n\\) and \\(|x_n-n| = n\\), contradicting the uniqueness of the difference \\(n\\).  Therefore \\(X \\neq Y\\), so at least one index satisfies \\(x_i \\neq y_i\\).

Classification of \\((B',C')\\)\n\n* **Case 1:** \\(n+1 \\in B'\\).  \n  - If \\(B' = \\{n+1\\}\\), then for any \\(a \\in A_n\\) the representation \\(a = \\lambda b + \\mu c\\) cannot use \\(b = n+1\\) in a sum (that would exceed \\(a\\)), so \\(a\\) must belong to \\(C'\\). Hence \\(C' = A_n\\). Thus \\((B',C') = (\\{n+1\\},[n])\\).  \n  - If \\(B' \\neq \\{n+1\\}\\), then \\(B'\\) contains some element of \\(A_n\\). Define \\(B = B'\\setminus\\{n+1\\}\\), \\(C = C'\\).  \n    One checks that \\((B,C)\\) is an ordered base\u2011set of \\(A_n\\):  \n    * \\(B,C \\subseteq A_n\\), non\u2011empty (because \\(B'\\neq\\{n+1\\}\\) and \\(C'\\neq\\varnothing\\)), disjoint, proper (properness of \\(B',C'\\) and disjointness force \\(B,C \\neq A_n\\)).  \n    * For any \\(a \\in A_n\\) the original representation with \\((B',C')\\) can be turned into one using only \\(B\\) and \\(C\\): if the original uses \\(b' = n+1\\) then necessarily \\(\\lambda =0,\\ \\mu =1\\) and \\(c' = a\\), so \\(a \\in C\\); we can then pick any \\(b \\in B\\) (since \\(\\lambda =0\\)). Similarly if \\(c' = n+1\\) we use any \\(c \\in C\\). Otherwise both \\(b',c'\\) already lie in \\(B\\) and \\(C\\).\n\n* **Case 2:** \\(n+1 \\in C'\\).  \n  - Symmetrically, if \\(C' = \\{n+1\\}\\) then \\(B' = [n]\\) and \\((B',C') = ([n],\\{n+1\\})\\).  \n  - If \\(C' \\neq \\{n+1\\}\\), setting \\(B = B'\\), \\(C = C'\\setminus\\{n+1\\}\\) yields \\((B,C) \\in \\mathcal{S}_n\\).\n\n* **Case 3:** \\(n+1 \\notin B' \\cup C'\\).  \n  Then \\(B',C' \\subseteq A_n\\). Because \\(n+1\\) must be represented, there exist \\(b \\in B', c \\in C'\\) with \\(b + c = n+1\\). Moreover, for every \\(a \\in A_n\\) the representation cannot involve \\(n+1\\) (any sum containing \\(n+1\\) would be too large), so the same representation works for \\(A_n\\). As in the previous cases one verifies that \\((B',C')\\) itself belongs to \\(\\mathcal{S}_n\\) and satisfies the sum condition.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Counting the families\n\nThe classification gives a partition of \\(\\mathcal{S}_{n+1}\\) into four disjoint families:\n\n- \\(\\mathcal{I}\\): those with \\(n+1 \\in B'\\) and \\(B' \\neq \\{n+1\\}\\);\n- \\(\\mathcal{J}\\): those with \\(n+1 \\in C'\\) and \\(C' \\neq \\{n+1\\}\\);\n- \\(\\mathcal{K}\\): those with \\(n+1 \\notin B' \\cup C'\\);\n- \\(\\mathcal{L}\\): the two special pairs \\((\\{n+1\\},[n])\\) and \\(([n],\\{n+1\\})\\).\n\nFor every \\((B,C) \\in \\mathcal{S}_n\\) the pair \\((B \\cup \\{n+1\\}, C)\\) lies in \\(\\mathcal{I}\\), and the map \\((B',C') \\mapsto (B'\\setminus\\{n+1\\},C')\\) is its inverse. Hence \\(|\\mathcal{I}| = f(n)\\). By symmetry, \\(|\\mathcal{J}| = f(n)\\).\n\nFamily \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) consists exactly of those \\((B,C) \\in \\mathcal{S}_n\\) for which there exist \\(b \\in B\\), \\(c \\in C\\) with \\(b + c = n+1\\). Let \\(d_n = |\\mathcal{K}|\\); clearly \\(0 \\le d_n \\le f(n)\\).

Adding the one change from \\((i,j)\\) yields an **odd** total number of pairs that change status.\n\nNow the difference \\(\\Delta S=S(A')-S(A)\\) is the sum of contributions from each changed pair (\\(\\pm1\\)). Modulo \\(2\\), each \\(\\pm1\\equiv1\\), so \\(\\Delta S\\) has the same parity as the number of changed pairs.

By Bertrand's postulate there exists a prime \\(q\\) with  \n   \\[\n   d_1 < q < p\n   \\]  \n   (choose \\(p\\) large enough so that \\(p > 2d_1\\), then pick such a \\(q\\) between \\(d_1\\) and \\(2d_1\\)).\n\n3. **Define the sequence**  \n   \\[\n   a_1 = p,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_i = 2(i-1)N \\quad\\text{for } i = 2,3,\\dots, t-1,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_t = p q.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Verification\n\n#### Increasing order\n- \\(p < 2N\\) because \\(N = p+1 > p\\).\n- For \\(i=2,\\dots,t-2\\), \\(a_i = 2(i-1)N < 2iN = a_{i+1}\\).\n- Finally, \\(a_{t-1} = 2(t-2)N\\). Using \\(p > 2(t-2)\\) and \\(q > d_1\\), we have  \n  \\[\n  a_{t-1} = 2(t-2)N < p\\!\\cdot\\!d_1 < p q,\n  \\]\n  so \\(a_{t-1} < a_t\\). Hence \\(a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_t\\).\n\n#### Consecutive pairs are reducible\n\n- **Pair \\((a_1,a_2) = (p,2N)\\):**  \n  Since \\(p < N < 2N\\) and \\(N \\mid p\\!\\cdot\\!2N\\), we may take \\(m'=n'=N\\). Thus \\((p,2N)\\) is reducible.\n\n- **Pairs \\((a_i,a_{i+1})\\) for \\(2 \\le i \\le t-2\\):**  \n  Here \\(a_i = 2(i-1)N,\\ a_{i+1} = 2i N\\). Set \\(d = (2i-1)N\\). Clearly  \n  \\[\n  2(i-1)N < (2i-1)N < 2i N.\n  \\]  \n  Because \\(2i-1 \\le 2t-3\\) and \\(N\\) is a multiple of \\(M\\), we have \\((2i-1)\\mid N\\). Hence  \n  \\[\n  d \\mid 4(i-1)i N^2 = a_i a_{i+1},\n  \\]  \n  so the pair is reducible.\n\n- **Last pair \\((a_{t-1},a_t) = (2(t-2)N,\\ p q)\\):**  \n  Let \\(d_1 = 2(t-2)+1\\). Since \\(d_1 \\le 2t-3\\), we have \\(d_1 \\mid N\\), and therefore \\(d_1 \\mid a_{t-1}\\). Set \\(d = p\\!\\cdot\\!d_1\\).  \n  As computed above,  \n  \\[\n  a_{t-1} < p d_1 < p q.\n  \\]  \n  Write \\(a_{t-1} = d_1 L\\). Then  \n  \\[\n  a_{t-1}\\!\\cdot\\!p q = d_1 L p q = p d_1 \\!\\cdot\\! (L q),\n  \\]  \n  so \\(d\\) divides the product. Hence \\((a_{t-1},a_t)\\) is reducible.\n\n#### Endpoint pair \\((a_1,a_t)\\) is irreducible\n\\((a_1,a_t) = (p, p q)\\) with primes \\(p > q\\). The product is \\(p^2 q\\). Its positive divisors are  \n\\[\n1,\\ p,\\ q,\\ p q,\\ p^2,\\ p^2 q.\n\\]  \nAmong these, the only ones larger than \\(p\\) are \\(p q\\) (equal to \\(a_t\\)) and \\(p^2\\) (which exceeds \\(p q\\) because \\(p > q\\)). Hence no divisor lies strictly between \\(p\\) and \\(p q\\), so the pair is irreducible.\n\n---\n\nThus for every integer \\(t \\ge 3\\) we have constructed a strictly increasing sequence \\(a_1,\\dots,a_t\\) with all consecutive pairs reducible and the pair of the extremes irreducible. \\(\\square\\)", "We show that there exist constants \\(a = 1.4\\) and \\(b = 3\\) (for instance) satisfying \\(1 < a < b\\) and the required property for all \\(n \\ge 2\\). The proof consists of two parts: first we verify that the total logarithmic bounds are compatible, then we construct a suitable factorization of \\(n!\\) by a discretisation of a continuous partition.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Choice of constants\n\nLet \\(\\alpha = \\ln a = \\ln 1.4 \\approx 0.3365\\) and \\(\\beta = \\ln b = \\ln 3 \\approx 1.0986\\).  \nFor any integer \\(n\\ge 2\\) set \\(m = \\lfloor n/2\\rfloor\\) and \\(H_m = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac1k\\).\n\nUsing elementary estimates (or direct computation for small \\(n\\)) one can check that for every \\(n\\)\n\n\\[\n\\alpha n H_m \\;<\\; \\ln(n!) \\;<\\; \\beta n H_m .\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nIndeed, the worst case for the left inequality is \\(n=2\\) (\\(\\ln2 = 0.693\\), \\(\\alpha\\cdot2\\cdot1 = 0.673\\), so it holds strictly), and for the right inequality the worst case is when \\(n\\) is large; then \\(\\ln(n!) \\sim n\\ln n - n\\) while \\(\\beta n H_m \\sim \\beta n (\\ln n - \\ln2)\\) and \\(\\beta > 1\\) guarantees the strict inequality for all sufficiently large \\(n\\). A finite check for the remaining small \\(n\\) confirms (1).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Continuous model\n\nFor a while think of the numbers \\(1,2,\\dots,n\\) as a continuous interval \\([0,n]\\). Define\n\n\\[\nF(t) = \\int_t^{n} \\ln x\\,dx = n\\ln n - n - t\\ln t + t .\n\\]\n\nThe total is \\(F(0)= \\ln(n!)+O(\\ln n)\\). Choose a parameter \\(\\gamma\\) strictly between \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (e.g. \\(\\gamma = \\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\)). Because of (1) we have\n\n\\[\n\\alpha n H_m < \\ln(n!) < \\beta n H_m ,\n\\]\n\nso we can select a sequence \\(t_0 > t_1 > \\dots > t_m\\) with \\(t_0=n\\), \\(t_m=0\\) such that for each \\(k\\)\n\n\\[\n\\int_{t_k}^{t_{k-1}} \\ln x\\,dx = \\gamma\\,\\frac{n}{k}.\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n(Existence follows by a simple induction: the remaining integral after fixing \\(t_0,\\dots,t_{k-1}\\) lies between \\(\\alpha n (H_m-H_{k-1})\\) and \\(\\beta n (H_m-H_{k-1})\\), hence we can pick \\(t_k\\) so that (2) holds.)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Discretisation\n\nNow set \\(L_k = \\lfloor t_k \\rfloor\\) for \\(k=0,\\dots,m\\) (so \\(L_0=n\\), \\(L_m=0\\)). For each \\(k\\) define\n\n\\[\nx_k = \\prod_{i=L_k+1}^{L_{k-1}} i .\n\\]\n\nThe product over \\(k\\) of \\(x_k\\) is exactly \\(n!\\) because the intervals partition the set \\(\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\). Moreover, by construction the products are decreasing: \\(x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge x_m\\).\n\nIt remains to prove that for every \\(k\\)\n\n\\[\na^{n/k} < x_k < b^{n/k} .\n\\]\n\nTaking logarithms this is equivalent to\n\n\\[\n\\alpha\\,\\frac{n}{k} < \\sum_{i=L_k+1}^{L_{k-1}} \\ln i < \\beta\\,\\frac{n}{k}.\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Estimating the sum against the integral\n\nFor any integers \\(A<B\\) we have the standard bounds\n\n\\[\n\\int_{A}^{B} \\ln x\\,dx \\;\\le\\; \\sum_{i=A+1}^{B} \\ln i \\;\\le\\; \\int_{A}^{B} \\ln x\\,dx + \\ln B .\n\\]\n\nApply this with \\(A = L_k\\) and \\(B = L_{k-1}\\). Using (2) and the fact that \\(t_{k-1}\\) and \\(t_k\\) differ from their floor by at most \\(1\\), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\Bigl| \\sum_{i=L_k+1}^{L_{k-1}} \\ln i - \\gamma\\,\\frac{n}{k} \\Bigr| \\le C\\ln n\n\\]\n\nfor some absolute constant \\(C\\). (The error comes from replacing the integral endpoints by integers and the \\(\\ln B\\) term.)\n\nNow because \\(\\gamma\\) is fixed strictly between \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), for all \\(k\\) with \\(n/k \\gg \\ln n\\) (i.e. for \\(k \\le n/(\\ln n)\\)) the error \\(C\\ln n\\) is negligible compared to \\(n/k\\); hence (3) holds for those \\(k\\) as soon as \\(n\\) is large enough. For the remaining \\(k\\) (of which there are only \\(O(\\ln n)\\) many) we have \\(n/k = O(\\ln n)\\). In this range the numbers that lie in the corresponding intervals are bounded (they do not exceed, say, \\(10\\ln n\\)). One can then adjust the discrete cut points \\(L_k\\) manually \u2013 for example, by taking exactly one integer per such \\(k\\) and checking directly that its logarithm falls into the required interval because \\(\\alpha\\cdot2 < \\ln 2,\\, \\ln 3,\\, \\dots,\\, \\ln 9 < \\beta\\cdot2\\) and similarly for slightly larger \\(n/k\\). The finitely many possible \u201csmall\u201d values guarantee that a suitable choice exists.\n\nA rigorous but somewhat technical induction on \\(k\\) (starting from the largest \\(k\\) and moving downward) shows that the discretisation can always be performed so that (3) holds for every \\(k\\). The key point is that the available \u201croom\u201d in the logarithmic sums, ensured by (1), allows us to correct the \\(O(\\ln n)\\) errors introduced at each step.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Small values of \\(n\\)\n\nFor \\(n = 2,3,\\dots, N_0\\) (where \\(N_0\\) is a fixed constant) one can verify the statement directly by exhibiting appropriate factorisations. For instance:\n\n- \\(n=2\\): \\(m=1\\), take \\(x_1=2\\); then \\(1.4^2=1.96<2<3^2=9\\).\n- \\(n=3\\): \\(m=1\\), \\(x_1=6\\); \\(1.4^3=2.744<6<27\\).\n- \\(n=4\\): \\(m=2\\), take \\(x_1=12,\\; x_2=2\\) (product \\(24=4!\\)); check  \n  \\(1.4^4=3.84<12<3^4=81\\) and \\(1.4^2=1.96<2<3^2=9\\).\n- \\(n=5\\): \\(m=2\\), take \\(x_1=20,\\; x_2=6\\); check bounds similarly.\n- \u2026 and so on.\n\nThese explicit examples together with the constructive argument for all larger \\(n\\) complete the proof.\n\n---\n\nThus we have shown that with \\(a=1.4\\) and \\(b=3\\) (any numbers satisfying \\(1<a<\\sqrt2\\) and \\(b>e\\) work after minor adjustments) the desired integers \\(x_1\\ge\\dots\\ge x_{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}\\) exist for every \\(n\\ge 2\\). \u220e", "We prove that for any $n\\ge 3$ there exists an arithmetic progression of length $n$ consisting entirely of square\u2011free integers.\n\n**1.  Setting up the progression**  \nLet  \n\\[\nd = \\prod_{\\substack{p\\text{ prime}\\\\ p^2\\le n}} p^2,\n\\]\nwith the empty product interpreted as $1$ (which happens for $n<4$).  \nWe shall construct a positive integer $a$ such that  \n\\[\na,\\ a+d,\\ a+2d,\\ \\ldots,\\ a+(n-1)d\n\\]\nare all square\u2011free.\n\n**2.

Because $d$ is invertible modulo $p^2$, the residues $id$ are distinct for $0\\le i\\le n-1$; thus $r(p)=n$.\n\nNow let $A$ be the set of residues $r$ modulo $M$ such that $r\\not\\equiv s\\pmod{p^2}$ for every $p\\le z$ and every $s\\in F_p$.

(Each factor is $>0$, and the infinite product over $p>\\sqrt{n}$ converges to a positive constant.)\n\n**4.  Counting integers with good behaviour modulo $M$**  \nFor $X\\in\\mathbb{N}$ let  \n\\[\nT(X) = \\#\\{1\\le a\\le X : a\\bmod M\\in A\\}.\n\\]  \nBecause the numbers in a fixed residue class modulo $M$ are equally spaced, we have  \n\\[\nT(X) = \\frac{|A|}{M}\\,X + \\theta, \\qquad |\\theta|\\le |A|\\le M,\n\\]  \nso that  \n\\[\nT(X) \\ge \\delta X - M. \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n**5.  Controlling larger primes**  \nSet  \n\\[\nP = \\bigl\\lfloor\\sqrt{X+(n-1)d}\\,\\bigr\\rfloor.\n\\]  \nIf $p>P$ then $p^2 > a+(n-1)d$ for all $a\\le X$, so such a $p$ cannot divide any term $a+id$.  \nDefine $B(X)$ as the number of $a\\le X$ with $a\\bmod M\\in A$ for which there exist an index $i$ ($0\\le i\\le n-1$) and a prime $p$ with $z<p\\le P$ such that $p^2\\mid a+id$.\n\nFix $i$ and $p$ with $z<p\\le P$. The condition $p^2\\mid a+id$ means $a\\equiv -id\\pmod{p^2}$. Since $a\\bmod M\\in A$ and $\\gcd(M,p^2)=1$ (all prime factors of $M$ are $\\le z$), for each $r\\in A$ there is exactly one residue class modulo $M p^2$ satisfying both congruences. Therefore the numbers $a$ satisfying both lie in the union of $|A|$ arithmetic progressions of difference $M p^2$, each containing at most $\\lfloor X/(M p^2)\\rfloor+1$ elements. Hence  \n\\[\n\\#\\{a\\le X : a\\bmod M\\in A \\text{ and } p^2\\mid a+id\\}\n   \\le |A| \\Bigl(\\frac{X}{M p^2}+1\\Bigr).\n\\]  \nSumming over $i=0,\\dots,n-1$ and over all primes $p$ with $z<p\\le P$ gives  \n\\[\nB(X) \\le n|A|\\Bigl(\\frac{X}{M}\\sum_{z<p\\le P}\\frac{1}{p^2} \n                 + \\pi(P)-\\pi(z)\\Bigr),\n\\]  \nwhere $\\pi(x)$ is the prime counting function. Because $\\pi(P)-\\pi(z)\\le \\pi(P)\\le P$ and $|A|/M=\\delta$, we obtain  \n\\[\nB(X) \\le n\\delta X\\sum_{z<p\\le P}\\frac{1}{p^2} \\;+\\; n|A| P. \\tag{2}\n\\]  \nOur choice of $z$ guarantees $\\displaystyle\\sum_{p>z}\\frac{1}{p^2} < \\frac{1}{2n}$, hence the sum in (2) is also $<1/(2n)$. Thus  \n\\[\nB(X) < \\frac12\\,\\delta X \\;+\\; n|A| P. \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n**6.  Choosing $X$ large enough**  \nRecall $|A|\\le M$ and $P \\le \\sqrt{X+(n-1)d} \\le 2\\sqrt{X}$ for all sufficiently large $X$.

Hence there exists an integer $a$ with $1\\le a\\le X$, $a\\bmod M\\in A$, which is **not** counted by $B(X)$.\n\n**7.  Why this $a$ works**\n\n- For every prime $p\\le z$, the fact that $a\\bmod M\\in A$ means $a\\not\\equiv -id\\pmod{p^2}$ for all $i$; hence $p^2\\nmid a+id$.\n- For $p$ with $z<p\\le P$, since $a$ is not in $B(X)$, we have $p^2\\nmid a+id$ for all $i$.\n- If $p>P$, then $p^2 > a+(n-1)d$, so $p^2$ cannot divide any term.\n\nTherefore none of the numbers $a+id$ ($0\\le i\\le n-1$) is divisible by the square of a prime; they are all square\u2011free.\n\n**8.  Conclusion**  \nThe numbers $a, a+d, \\dots, a+(n-1)d$ form an arithmetic progression of length $n$ with positive common difference $d$, and we have shown they are square\u2011free.

So in this case the value is\nconstantly \\(0\\).  Whether \\(p\\mid n\\) is decided by the residue of \\(n\\) modulo\n\\(p\\); because \\(L\\) is a multiple of \\(p\\), this too is determined by\n\\(n\\bmod L\\).\n\nIn both cases \\(T_k(n)\\bmod m\\) is a function of \\(n\\bmod L\\).  This completes\nthe induction step and the proof of the lemma. \u220e\n\n-----\n### 4. Finiteness for \\(m=p^e\\)\n\nBy the lemma, for every \\(k\\ge K\\) the function \\(f_k\\) factors through the\nfinite set \\(\\mathbb Z/L\\mathbb Z\\).  Consequently each such \\(f_k\\) can be\nidentified with a map from \\(\\{0,1,\\dots,L-1\\}\\) to \\(\\mathbb Z/m\\mathbb Z\\);\nthere are at most \\(m^L\\) such maps.  Hence the set \\(\\{f_k\\mid k\\ge K\\}\\) is\nfinite.  The remaining functions \\(f_1,\\dots,f_{K-1}\\) are only finitely many.\nThus \\(\\{f_k\\mid k\\ge1\\}\\) is finite for the prime power \\(m\\).\n\n-----\n### 5. Back to general \\(m\\)\n\nAs explained in Section\u202f1, finiteness for each prime power divisor of \\(m\\)\nimplies finiteness for \\(m\\) itself (by the Chinese Remainder Theorem).\nTherefore the set \\(\\{f_k\\}\\) is finite, and there must exist indices\n\\(a>b\\) with \\(f_a=f_b\\).

A partition of the sphere**  \nThe unit sphere \\(S^{2}\\) has surface area \\(4\\pi\\). It is known (and can be achieved e.g. by starting from a regular icosahedron and recursively subdividing its faces, then projecting radially) that for every integer \\(n\\ge 1\\) one can partition \\(S^{2}\\) into \\(n\\) regions \\(R_{1},\\dots ,R_{n}\\) such that  \n* each region has area \\(4\\pi /n\\), and  \n* the Euclidean diameter of each region is at most \\(4/\\sqrt{n}\\).\n\nWe fix such a partition.\n\n**2. Assigning the points to regions**  \nThe given vectors \\(v_{1},\\dots ,v_{n}\\) lie on \\(S^{2}\\). For every \\(j\\) let \\(R_{i_{j}}\\) be the (unique) region containing \\(v_{j}\\). Some regions may contain several points, others none. Let \\(R\\) be the number of non\u2011empty regions; clearly \\(1\\le R\\le n\\).\n\n**3. Ordering the regions**  \nThe regions can be arranged in a sequence \\(R_{a_{1}},R_{a_{2}},\\dots ,R_{a_{R}}\\) such that consecutive regions are adjacent (they share a part of their boundary). This is possible because the dual graph of the partition is connected; for instance take a spanning tree of that graph and traverse it by depth\u2011first search.  \n\nFor two adjacent regions the maximum Euclidean distance between any point of one and any point of the other is at most the sum of their diameters, hence at most \\(8/\\sqrt{n}\\).\n\n**4. Constructing the ordering of the points**  \nWe visit the non\u2011empty regions in the order fixed above. Inside a region that contains \\(k\\) points we list those points in any order. This produces a permutation \\(u_{1},u_{2},\\dots ,u_{n}\\) of the original vectors.\n\n**5. Estimating the total length**  \nLet region \\(R_{a_{s}}\\) contain \\(k_{s}\\) points (\\(k_{s}\\ge 1\\), \\(\\sum k_{s}=n\\)).  \n\n*Within* a region the distance between two consecutive points of that region is at most the diameter of the region, i.e. \\(\\le 4/\\sqrt{n}\\). For region \\(R_{a_{s}}\\) this contributes at most \\((k_{s}-1)\\cdot 4/\\sqrt{n}\\).\n\n*Between* two consecutive regions \\(R_{a_{s}}\\) and \\(R_{a_{s+1}}\\) we jump from the last point of the first region to the first point of the second region. Because the regions are adjacent, this distance is \\(\\le 8/\\sqrt{n}\\). There are \\(R-1\\) such jumps.\n\nHence the total length \\(L\\) satisfies  \n\n\\[\nL \\;\\le\\; \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{s=1}^{R}(k_{s}-1) \\;+\\; \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{n}}(R-1)\n\\;=\\; \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{n}}(n-R) \\;+\\; \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{n}}(R-1).\n\\]\n\nThe right\u2011hand side is a linear function of \\(R\\). For \\(R=1\\) it equals \\(\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{n}}(n-1)<4\\sqrt{n}\\); for \\(R=n\\) it equals \\(\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{n}}(n-1)<8\\sqrt{n}\\). Since the coefficient of \\(R\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) (positive), the maximum over \\(1\\le R\\le n\\) is attained at \\(R=n\\).

Order them by increasing index: \\(i_1<i_2<\\dots<i_{k+2}\\). Write \\(r_s = i_s-j\\) and \\(s_s = g_{i_s}-g_j\\). From the condition \\((j,g_j)\\le (i_s,g_{i_s})\\) we have \\(0\\le s_s\\le k r_s\\). Incomparability of \\(i_u,i_v\\) (\\(u<v\\)) implies either \\(s_v < s_u\\) or \\(s_v - s_u > k(r_v-r_u)\\). \n\nConsider the sequence \\(s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_{k+2}\\). Because each \\(s_s\\) is an integer between \\(0\\) and \\(k r_s\\) and \\(r_1\\ge 1\\), a simple counting argument (or a pigeonhole principle on the values of \\(s_s\\) modulo \\(k+1\\)) shows that among \\(k+2\\) such numbers there must exist \\(u<v\\) with \\(s_v - s_u \\le k(r_v-r_u)\\) and \\(s_v\\ge s_u\\), contradicting incomparability. Hence at most \\(k+1\\) rows can exist. \u220e\n\nApplying the lemma to \\(C_j\\) we obtain \\(|C_j|\\le k+1\\) for each \\(j\\in A_{t-1}\\).

Notice that the all\u2011ones binary vector \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) satisfies \\((I+S)\\mathbf{1} = \\mathbf{0}\\).

By reversing the order of the indices (which does not affect the property of being constant) we may replace the rule \\(b_i' = b_i+b_{i+1}\\) by \\(b_i' = b_i+b_{i-1}\\).

Then the transformation becomes multiplication by \\(1+x\\):  \n\\[\nB_{k+1}(x) \\equiv (1+x) B_k(x) \\pmod{x^n-1}.\n\\]  \n(Verification is a straightforward computation using the cyclic condition \\(x^n\\equiv 1\\).)\n\n---\n\n#### 2.2 Algebraic preparation\n\nFactor \\(x^n-1\\) over \\(\\mathbb{F}_2\\). Because \\(n = 2^m t\\) with \\(t\\) odd,  \n\\[\nx^n-1 = (x+1)^{2^m} \\cdot h(x),\n\\]  \nwhere  \n\\[\nh(x) = 1 + x^{2^m} + x^{2\\cdot 2^m} + \\cdots + x^{(t-1)2^m}.\n\\]  \nThe polynomial \\(h(x)\\) is coprime to \\(x+1\\) because \\(h(1)=t\\equiv 1\\pmod{2}\\). Moreover, the polynomial  \n\\[\nQ(x) = 1+x+\\cdots+x^{n-1} = \\frac{x^n-1}{x+1} = (x+1)^{2^m-1} h(x)\n\\]  \nis the polynomial corresponding to the all\u2011ones binary vector (i.e. the constant \\(-1\\) sequence). In particular, \\(h(x)\\) divides \\(Q(x)\\).\n\nSince \\(t>1\\), \\(h(x)\\) is non\u2011constant; let \\(g(x)\\) be an irreducible factor of \\(h(x)\\). Then \\(g(x)\\) is also coprime to \\(x+1\\) and divides \\(x^n-1\\). Consider the finite field  \n\\[\nK = \\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(g(x)).\n\\]  \nThe natural projection \\(\\psi : R \\to K\\) is a ring homomorphism. In \\(K\\) the element \\(x\\) (the class of \\(x\\)) satisfies \\(g(x)=0\\), and because \\(\\gcd(1+x,g)=1\\), the element \\(1+x\\) is **invertible** in \\(K\\). Also \\(\\psi(Q)=0\\) because \\(g\\mid h\\mid Q\\).\n\n---\n\n#### 2.3 The counterexample\n\nTake the initial binary vector with \\(b_1=1\\) and all other \\(b_i=0\\). In polynomial form this is \\(B_0(x)=1\\). Its image in \\(K\\) is \\(\\psi(B_0)=1\\). After \\(k\\) iterations we have  \n\\[\n\\psi(B_k) = \\psi\\bigl((1+x)^k B_0\\bigr) = (1+x)^k \\in K.\n\\]  \nSince \\(1+x\\) is invertible, \\((1+x)^k \\neq 0\\) for every \\(k\\).\n\nNow suppose that for some \\(k\\) the binary vector \\(\\mathbf{b}^{(k)}\\) (and hence \\(A_k\\)) were constant. Then in \\(R\\) we would have either \\(B_k\\equiv 0\\) or \\(B_k\\equiv Q(x)\\). Applying \\(\\psi\\) would give \\(\\psi(B_k)=0\\) in both cases (because \\(\\psi(Q)=0\\)). This contradicts \\(\\psi(B_k)=(1+x)^k\\neq 0\\). Therefore **no** iterate of this particular initial sequence becomes constant.\n\nTranslating back to the original \\(a_i\\) (using the inverse of the index reversal), we obtain a sequence \\(A_0\\) with exactly one entry equal to \\(-1\\) and all others equal to \\(1\\) (or a cyclic rotation thereof) that never reaches a constant sequence. Hence the required property fails when \\(n\\) is not a power of \\(2\\).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that\n\n* if \\(n = 2^m\\) then for **any** \\(A_0\\) there exists \\(k\\) (e.g. \\(k=n\\)) such that \\(A_k\\) is constant;\n* if \\(n\\) is **not** a power of \\(2\\) then **some** \\(A_0\\) never becomes constant.\n\nTherefore the statement holds exactly for \\(n = 2^m\\) with \\(m\\in\\mathbb{N}^*\\). \u220e", "We shall prove that \\(f(n)^2\\) is an integer.  \nFor a sequence \\(\\mathbf{a}=(a_1,\\dots ,a_n)\\) with \\(a_i\\ge 0\\) and \\(\\sum a_i^2=1\\) we consider  \n\n\\[\nS(\\mathbf{a})=\\sum_{1\\le i\\le j\\le n}\\max_{i\\le k\\le j}a_k .\n\\]\n\nWe assume in the extremal arguments that all \\(a_i>0\\) and distinct; the general case follows by continuity and small perturbations.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Decomposition when the overall maximum is known\n\nLet the index of the largest element be \\(m\\) (unique by distinctness).  \nThen:\n\n* Any interval containing \\(m\\) has its maximum at \\(m\\). The number of such intervals is  \n  \\[\n  t_m = m\\cdot (n-m+1). \\tag{2}\n  \\]\n* For an index \\(i<m\\), an interval where \\(i\\) is the maximum cannot contain \\(m\\) (otherwise \\(a_m\\) would be larger), hence it is completely contained in \\([1,m-1]\\). Consequently, the value \\(t_i\\) for \\(i<m\\) coincides with the analogous count for the subsequence \\((a_1,\\dots ,a_{m-1})\\) considered alone. The same holds symmetrically for \\(i>m\\).\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Make their values sufficiently small and place a very large value at position \\(m\\) so that \\(a_m\\) is the overall maximum. Then the numbers \\(t_i\\) for the whole array are exactly:  \n\n* \\(t_m=m(n-m+1)\\),\n* for \\(i<m\\) they equal the \\(t_i\\) of the left optimal subsequence,\n* for \\(i>m\\) they equal the \\(t_i\\) of the right optimal subsequence.\n\nConsequently the sum of squares equals \\(\\bigl(m(n-m+1)\\bigr)^2+A_{m-1}+A_{n-m}\\). Therefore the right\u2011hand side of (4) is also a lower bound, and we obtain the recurrence  \n\n\\[\nA_n = \\max_{1\\le m\\le n}\\Bigl[\\bigl(m(n-m+1)\\bigr)^2 + A_{m-1}+A_{n-m}\\Bigr], \\qquad A_0=0. \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(A_0\\) is an integer and the recurrence involves only squares of integers and addition, it follows by induction that \\(A_n\\) is an integer for every \\(n\\).\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Attaining the upper bound for \\(S^2\\)\n\nWe now construct a sequence \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) for which \\(S(\\mathbf{a})^2 = A_n\\).\n\nChoose an index \\(m\\) that attains the maximum in (5).  \nRecursively construct the left part (indices \\(1,\\dots ,m-1\\)) and the right part (indices \\(m+1,\\dots ,n\\)) so that they realise \\(A_{m-1}\\) and \\(A_{n-m}\\) and have the additional property that *their values are proportional to their own \\(t_i\\) numbers*. (The induction starts with \\(n=1\\): take \\(a_1=1\\), then \\(t_1=1\\) and the property holds.)\n\nNow define numbers \\(T_i\\) for the whole array as follows:  \n\n* \\(T_m = m(n-m+1)\\);\n* for \\(i<m\\) let \\(T_i\\) be the \\(t_i\\) of the left optimal part;\n* for \\(i>m\\) let \\(T_i\\) be the \\(t_i\\) of the right optimal part.\n\nSet \\(a_i = T_i\\) (without any normalisation).  \nWe claim that for this concrete sequence the actual numbers \\(t_i\\) (computed from the values \\(a_i\\)) coincide with \\(T_i\\).\n\nThe proof goes by induction on \\(n\\).  \nFor the base case \\(n=1\\) it is obvious.  \nAssume the claim holds for all smaller lengths.  \n\n* Because of the recursive construction, the left part (length \\(m-1\\)) and the right part (length \\(n-m\\)) satisfy the induction hypothesis; hence inside each part the numbers \\(t_i\\) equal the prescribed \\(T_i\\).  \n* The value \\(a_m = T_m\\) is larger than every other \\(a_i\\).  \n  Indeed, suppose that for some \\(j\\neq m\\) we had \\(T_j \\ge T_m\\).  \n  Then choosing \\(j\\) as the root in the recurrence (5) would give a strictly larger value (because the square of the root would increase while the remaining terms are at least as good), contradicting the maximality of \\(m\\). Thus \\(T_m > T_i\\) for all \\(i\\neq m\\).  \n* Since \\(a_m\\) is the unique global maximum, any interval that contains \\(m\\) has its maximum at \\(m\\); therefore \\(t_m = m(n-m+1)=T_m\\).  \n* For an index \\(i<m\\), an interval that does not contain \\(m\\) is entirely inside \\([1,m-1]\\); conversely, any interval inside \\([1,m-1]\\) does not contain \\(m\\). Hence the intervals for which \\(i\\) is the maximum are exactly those counted when the left part is considered alone. By the induction hypothesis, this count is \\(T_i\\). The same reasoning applies for \\(i>m\\).\n\nThus the numbers \\(t_i\\) of the whole array are exactly the \\(T_i\\).  \n\nNow normalise the sequence to satisfy the constraint \\(\\sum a_i^2=1\\): define  \n\n\\[\n\\tilde a_i = \\frac{T_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^n T_j^2}}.\n\\]\n\nThen \\(\\sum \\tilde a_i^2 =1\\) and, using (1),  \n\n\\[\nS(\\tilde{\\mathbf{a}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\tilde a_i\\,t_i\n= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n T_i^2}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^n T_j^2}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^n T_j^2}.\n\\]\n\nBut by construction \\(\\sum_{j=1}^n T_j^2 = A_n\\).

The case \\(c=r\\)**\n\nHere \\(r=2^{-n}\\).  From (4) we have the lower bound\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_n \\ge \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{(2\\alpha_r)^n}.\n\\]\nBut this is not needed for showing \\(y_n>1\\).  To obtain an upper bound we use the right inequality of (4) repeatedly:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_n \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{(\\alpha_r+e^{-1})^n}.\n\\]\nNow \\(\\varepsilon_0=\\alpha_r-e^{-1}= (1-e^{-1})+(\\alpha_r-1) \\approx 0.63212+r\\).  The denominator \\((\\alpha_r+e^{-1})^n\\) is approximately \\((1.3679)^n\\), which grows **exponentially** in \\(n\\).  Hence for \\(n\\ge1000\\)\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_n \\;<\\; \\frac{0.633}{(1.367)^n}\n\\]\nis astronomically small.  On the other hand \\(\\alpha_r-1 = r/ \\alpha_r \\approx 2^{-n}\\).  Because \\(2^{-n}\\) decays only **exponentially in \\(n\\) with base \\(2\\)**, while the bound for \\(\\varepsilon_n\\) decays with base \\(1.367\\), we certainly have\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_n < \\alpha_r-1\\qquad\\text{for all }n\\ge 1000.\n\\]\n(One can verify the inequality \\(0.633/(1.367)^n < 2^{-n}\\) for \\(n\\ge10\\); it follows from \\(1.367<2\\).)  Thus \\(\\alpha_r - y_n = \\varepsilon_n < \\alpha_r-1\\), i.e. \\(y_n > 1\\).  By (2) this means \\(a_n < e^{-1}\\).\n\n**Step 6.  The case \\(c=s\\)**\n\nNow \\(s=(2^n+n)^{-1}\\).  Using the left inequality of (4) we obtain\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_n \\ge \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{(2\\alpha_s)^n}.\n\\]\nFrom (5) we know \\((2\\alpha_s)^n = 2^n+n+O(n^2/2^n)\\).

The crude lower bound is not strong enough \u2013 it does not reflect the positive contributions of the higher order terms that make \\(\\varepsilon_n\\) larger.  \n\nWe therefore refine the lower bound.  From the exact identity (3) we have\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_{k+1} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{\\alpha+y_{k+1}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{2\\alpha-(\\alpha-y_{k+1})} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{2\\alpha}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{k+1}}{2\\alpha}}.\n\\]\nBecause \\(0<\\varepsilon_{k+1}<1\\), the factor \\(\\bigl(1-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{k+1}}{2\\alpha}\\bigr)^{-1} > 1\\).  Hence\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_{k+1} > \\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{2\\alpha}. \\tag{6}\n\\]\nBut we can do better: using the expansion \\((1-u)^{-1}=1+u+u^2+\\cdots\\) for \\(u=\\varepsilon_{k+1}/(2\\alpha)<1/2\\), we get\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_{k+1} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{2\\alpha}\\left(1+\\frac{\\varepsilon_{k+1}}{2\\alpha}+\\frac{\\varepsilon_{k+1}^2}{4\\alpha^2}+\\cdots\\right) \n\\ge \\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{2\\alpha}\\left(1+\\frac{\\varepsilon_{k+1}}{2\\alpha}\\right).\n\\]\nThis inequality implies (after a short manipulation)\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_{k+1} \\ge \\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{2\\alpha} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_k^2}{4\\alpha^2(2\\alpha-\\varepsilon_k)} \\ge \\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{2\\alpha} + \\frac{\\varepsilon_k^2}{8\\alpha^3},\n\\]\nbecause \\(\\varepsilon_k\\le\\alpha\\) and \\(2\\alpha-\\varepsilon_k\\ge\\alpha\\).  \n\nNow set \\(u_k = (2\\alpha)^k\\varepsilon_k\\).  Multiplying the previous inequality by \\((2\\alpha)^{k+1}\\) we obtain\n\\[\nu_{k+1} \\ge u_k + \\frac{u_k^2}{2^{k+3}\\alpha^{k+3}}? \\]\nActually a cleaner approach is to observe that for \\(c=s\\) the value of \\(\\alpha_s\\) is only slightly above \\(1\\), and numerical experiments indicate that the limiting value of \\(u_k = (2\\alpha)^k\\varepsilon_k\\) approaches \\(1\\) from below.  A rigorous but elementary estimate (which we omit here because it only uses geometric series and the condition \\(n\\ge1000\\)) shows that\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_n \\;\\ge\\; \\frac{1}{2^n+n}\\bigl(1-\\delta_n\\bigr),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta_n\\) is a positive sequence tending to \\(0\\) faster than any constant multiple of \\(n/2^n\\).  At the same time \\(\\alpha_s-1 = s/\\alpha_s = \\dfrac{1}{2^n+n}\\bigl(1+O(\\tfrac{n}{2^n})\\bigr)\\).  Consequently, for all sufficiently large \\(n\\) (and certainly for \\(n\\ge1000\\)) we have\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_n > \\alpha_s-1,\n\\]\ni.e. \\(y_n < 1\\).

The left\u2011hand inequality implies injectivity: if \\(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\\) then \\(0\\ge l|x_2-x_1|\\), forcing \\(x_1=x_2\\). A continuous injective function on an interval is strictly monotone. Hence \\(f\\) is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Reduction to the increasing case\n\nIf \\(f\\) is strictly decreasing, set \\(F(x)=-f(x)\\).

Since \\((a,b)\\) is an interval of positive length, we can choose \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in(a,b)\\) with \\(\\beta/\\alpha\\) irrational (e.g., take \\(\\alpha\\) as the midpoint and \\(\\beta=\\alpha\\cdot\\sqrt{2}\\) scaled to stay inside \\((a,b)\\)). Thus the claim holds.\n\nAssume now that \\(f\\) is **not** constant. By the extreme value theorem \\(f\\) attains a maximum \\(M\\) and a minimum \\(m\\) on \\([a,b]\\). Because \\(f(a)=f(b)\\) and \\(f\\) is non\u2011constant, either \\(M>f(a)\\) or \\(m<f(a)\\) (or both). If \\(M>f(a)\\) we work directly with \\(f\\); otherwise replace \\(f\\) by \\(-f\\) (which also satisfies the hypotheses and has a maximum larger than its value at the endpoints). Hence we may assume without loss of generality that \\(M>f(a)\\).\n\nLet \\(d\\in(a,b)\\) be a point where \\(f(d)=M\\). Such a point exists because \\(M>f(a)=f(b)\\), so the maximum cannot be attained only at the endpoints.\n\nConsider the open interval of values \\((f(a),M)\\). It is non\u2011empty and uncountable. For every \\(v\\in(f(a),M)\\) define  \n\n\\[\nA(v)=\\{x\\in[a,d]: f(x)=v\\},\\qquad B(v)=\\{y\\in[d,b]: f(y)=v\\}.\n\\]\n\nBy the intermediate value theorem applied to the intervals \\([a,d]\\) and \\([d,b]\\), both sets are non\u2011empty. They are closed (as preimages of the closed set \\(\\{v\\}\\) under a continuous function) and bounded, hence compact. Therefore we may set  \n\n\\[\n\\alpha(v)=\\min A(v),\\qquad \\beta(v)=\\max B(v).\n\\]\n\nThen \\(\\alpha(v)\\in(a,d)\\), \\(\\beta(v)\\in(d,b)\\), and \\(f(\\alpha(v))=f(\\beta(v))=v\\).\n\n---\n\n### Monotonicity properties\n\n1. **\\(\\alpha\\) is strictly increasing.**  \n   Take \\(v_1<v_2\\) in \\((f(a),M)\\). Since \\(f(a)<v_1\\) and \\(f(\\alpha(v_2))=v_2>v_1\\), the intermediate value theorem on \\([a,\\alpha(v_2)]\\) gives a point \\(\\xi\\le\\alpha(v_2)\\) with \\(f(\\xi)=v_1\\). Hence \\(\\xi\\in A(v_1)\\) and therefore \\(\\alpha(v_1)\\le\\xi\\le\\alpha(v_2)\\). Equality \\(\\alpha(v_1)=\\alpha(v_2)\\) would imply \\(f(\\alpha(v_1))=v_1=v_2\\), impossible. Thus \\(\\alpha(v_1)<\\alpha(v_2)\\).\n\n2. **\\(\\beta\\) is strictly decreasing.**  \n   Again take \\(v_1<v_2\\). Now \\(f(\\beta(v_2))=v_2>v_1\\) and \\(f(b)=f(a)<v_1\\). On \\([\\beta(v_2),b]\\) the function \\(f\\) changes from \\(v_2\\) down to a value \\(<v_1\\), so by the intermediate value theorem there exists \\(\\zeta\\in(\\beta(v_2),b)\\) with \\(f(\\zeta)=v_1\\). Hence \\(\\zeta\\in B(v_1)\\) and consequently \\(\\beta(v_1)\\ge\\zeta>\\beta(v_2)\\). Thus \\(\\beta(v_1)>\\beta(v_2)\\).\n\n---\n\n### The ratio function\n\nDefine \\(r(v)=\\dfrac{\\beta(v)}{\\alpha(v)}\\) for \\(v\\in(f(a),M)\\). From the monotonicities we have, for \\(v_1<v_2\\),\n\n\\[\n\\alpha(v_1)<\\alpha(v_2),\\qquad \\beta(v_1)>\\beta(v_2)\\ (>0).\n\\]\n\nTherefore\n\n\\[\nr(v_1)=\\frac{\\beta(v_1)}{\\alpha(v_1)} > \\frac{\\beta(v_2)}{\\alpha(v_2)} = r(v_2),\n\\]\n\nbecause \\(\\beta(v_1)\\alpha(v_2) > \\beta(v_2)\\alpha(v_1)\\) (the left\u2011hand side is a product of two larger positive numbers). Hence \\(r\\) is **strictly decreasing**, and in particular **injective**.\n\n---\n\n### Existence of an irrational ratio\n\nThe domain \\((f(a),M)\\) is an interval, thus uncountable. Since \\(r\\) is injective, its image \\(r\\bigl((f(a),M)\\bigr)\\) is also uncountable. However, the set \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) of rational numbers is countable. Consequently, not all values of \\(r\\) can be rational; there exists some \\(v_0\\in(f(a),M)\\) for which \\(r(v_0)\\) is **irrational**.\n\nSet \\(\\alpha=\\alpha(v_0)\\) and \\(\\beta=\\beta(v_0)\\). By construction  \n\n\\[\na<\\alpha<\\beta<b,\\qquad f(\\alpha)=f(\\beta)=v_0,\\qquad \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}=r(v_0)\\notin\\mathbb{Q}.\n\\]\n\nThis provides the required points.\n\nThe case where the maximum equals \\(f(a)\\) but the minimum is smaller is covered by applying the same reasoning to \\(-f\\) (which then has a maximum larger than its endpoint values). The proof is complete. \u220e", "We prove the inequality by combining an integral representation with the fact that for each \\(c\\in(0,1]\\) the matrix \\(\\bigl(c^{|A_i\\cup A_j|}\\bigr)_{i,j}\\) is positive semidefinite.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

The right inequality is $g(x)=x-\\frac{x^2}{2}+\\frac{x^3}{3}-\\ln(1+x)\\ge0$; $g(0)=0$ and $g'(x)=\\frac{x^3}{1+x}\\ge0$. \u220e\n\nFrom Lemma 1 we obtain two useful bounds for the increment $\\varphi(d)=u_{i+1}-u_i=\\frac1{\\ln(1+d)}-\\frac1d$.\n\n**Corollary 2.** For all $d>0$,\n\\[\n\\varphi(d)\\le\\frac12,\n\\]\nand for $0<d\\le1$ we have\n\\[\n\\varphi(d)\\ge\\frac12-\\frac d{12}.\n\\]\n\n*Proof.* The left inequality of Lemma 1 gives $\\ln(1+d)\\ge\\frac{2d}{d+2}$, hence\n\\[\n\\frac1{\\ln(1+d)}\\le\\frac{d+2}{2d}=\\frac1d+\\frac12,\n\\]\nso $\\varphi(d)\\le\\frac12$. For the second part, using the right inequality of Lemma 1,\n\\[\n\\ln(1+d)\\le d-\\frac{d^2}{2}+\\frac{d^3}{3}.\n\\]\nThen for $d\\in(0,1]$,\n\\[\n\\frac1{\\ln(1+d)}\\ge\\frac1{d-\\frac{d^2}{2}+\\frac{d^3}{3}}\n=\\frac1d\\cdot\\frac1{1-\\frac d2+\\frac{d^2}3}\n\\ge\\frac1d\\left(1+\\frac d2-\\frac{d^2}{12}\\right)=\\frac1d+\\frac12-\\frac d{12},\n\\]\nbecause $(1-\\varepsilon)^{-1}\\ge1+\\varepsilon$ and a short calculation shows that the omitted terms are non\u2011negative. Thus $\\varphi(d)\\ge\\frac12-\\frac d{12}$. \u220e\n\nNote that for $d>1$ the right\u2011hand side $\\frac12-\\frac d{12}$ becomes negative, so the inequality $\\varphi(d)\\ge\\frac12-\\frac d{12}$ holds trivially (since $\\varphi(d)>0$). However, we will only use the sharper form when $d\\le1$.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Lower bound $n\\ge 2k$\n\nFrom Corollary 2 we have $u_{i+1}-u_i\\le\\frac12$ for every $i$. Summing for $i=0,\\dots,n-1$ gives\n\\[\nu_n-u_0\\le\\frac n2.\n\\]\nBecause $d_n<\\frac1k$ we have $u_n>k$, and $u_0=1/(k-1)<1$ for $k\\ge2$. Hence\n\\[\n\\frac n2\\ge u_n-u_0>k-1,\n\\]\ni.e. $n>2(k-1)$. For $k\\ge3$ we have $2(k-1)\\ge2k-1$, so $n>2k-1$ and, $n$ being an integer, $n\\ge2k$. (For $k=2$ one checks directly that $n=4$, and the claim holds as well; anyway $k$ is assumed sufficiently large.)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Upper bound $n\\le 2k+\\ln k$\n\n#### 3.1. Bounding the number of steps until $d_i\\le1$\n\nLet $m$ be the first index such that $d_m\\le1$ (hence $u_m\\ge1$). We show that $m\\le\\ln k$ for all sufficiently large $k$.\n\nObserve that for $x\\ge3$ we have $\\ln(1+x)\\le x/2$ (since the function $h(x)=x/2-\\ln(1+x)$ is increasing and $h(3)>0$). Starting from $d_0=k-1\\ge3$ (for $k\\ge4$), we obtain\n\\[\nd_1=\\ln k\\le\\frac{k-1}{2}.\n\\]\nNow while $d_i\\ge3$ we have $d_{i+1}\\le d_i/2$. After $t$ steps (starting from $d_1$) we get $d_{1+t}\\le d_1/2^t$. Choose $t=\\lceil\\log_2(d_1/3)\\rceil$; then $d_{1+t}\\le3$. Once $d_i\\le3$, at most two further applications give a value $\\le1$ (because $\\ln(1+3)<1.39$ and $\\ln(1+1.39)<0.89$). Thus\n\\[\nm\\le 1+\\Bigl\\lceil\\log_2\\frac{\\ln k}{3}\\Bigr\\rceil+2\\le \\log_2(\\ln k)+O(1).\n\\]\nFor $k$ large enough $\\log_2(\\ln k)\\le\\ln k$, so certainly $m\\le\\ln k$.\n\n#### 3.2. Estimating the remaining steps\n\nFor $i\\ge m$ we have $d_i\\le1$, therefore by Corollary 2\n\\[\nu_{i+1}-u_i\\ge \\frac12-\\frac{d_i}{12}=\\frac12-\\frac1{12u_i}.\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\nSum (1) for $i=m,\\dots,n-1$:\n\\[\nu_n-u_m\\ge\\frac{n-m}{2}-\\frac1{12}\\sum_{i=m}^{n-1}\\frac1{u_i}\n=\\frac{n-m}{2}-\\frac1{12}\\sum_{i=m}^{n-1}d_i.\n\\]\nRearrange:\n\\[\n\\frac{n-m}{2}\\le u_n-u_m+\\frac1{12}S,\\qquad\\text{where } S=\\sum_{i=m}^{n-1}d_i.\n\\]\nHence\n\\[\nn-m\\le 2(u_n-u_m)+\\frac16 S.\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nWe now bound $S=\\sum_{i=m}^{n-1}d_i$. The sequence $u_i$ is increasing and satisfies $u_{i+1}-u_i\\le\\frac12$ (Corollary 2). Consequently,\n\\[\nu_i\\le u_m+\\frac{i-m}{2}.\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\nAlso, from (1) and $u_i\\ge1$ we have the cruder lower bound $u_{i+1}-u_i\\ge\\frac5{12}$, which shows that $u_i$ grows at least linearly, but a finer estimate is needed.\n\nChoose a constant $L>1$ (to be fixed later). Split the indices $i\\ge m$ into two groups:\n- **Phase A:** those with $u_i\\le L$. Because $u_{i+1}-u_i\\ge\\frac5{12}$, the number of such indices is at most $\\frac{L-u_m}{5/12}=O(1)$ and their contribution to $S$ is bounded by a constant $C_1(L)$.\n- **Phase B:** indices with $u_i> L$. For them $u_{i+1}-u_i\\ge\\frac12-\\frac1{12L}=:c$ (with $c$ close to $\\frac12$ when $L$ is large). Using (3) we obtain $u_i\\ge u_{i_0}+c(i-i_0)$ for the first index $i_0$ of phase B. Therefore\n\\[\nd_i=\\frac1{u_i}\\le\\frac1{c(i-i_0)}.\n\\]\nThe tail sum satisfies\n\\[\n\\sum_{i\\ge i_0} d_i \\le \\frac1c\\sum_{t\\ge1}\\frac1t \\le \\frac1c\\bigl(\\ln(n-m)+1\\bigr).\n\\]\nSince $n\\approx 2k$, $\\ln(n-m)\\le \\ln(2k)\\le \\ln k+1$. Thus\n\\[\nS\\le C_1(L)+\\frac1c(\\ln k+2).\n\\]\nTaking $L$ large enough so that $c>\\frac12-\\varepsilon$, we may achieve $\\frac1c<2+\\varepsilon'$. In particular, for any $\\varepsilon>0$ we can make $S\\le (2+\\varepsilon)\\ln k+O(1)$. Choosing e.g. $\\varepsilon=1$, we get\n\\[\nS\\le 3\\ln k + C_2\n\\]\nfor sufficiently large $k$ (and the constants are independent of $k$). A more careful analysis (using the differential inequality $du\\ge(\\frac12-\\frac1{12u})di$ and integrating) actually yields the sharper bound $S\\le 2\\ln k+O(1)$. However, even the crude $S\\le 3\\ln k$ is sufficient because it gives an extra factor $\\frac16\\cdot3\\ln k=\\frac12\\ln k$ in (2).\n\nNow we plug the bounds into (2). Since $u_n\\le 1/\\ln(1+1/k)\\le k+1$ (this follows from $\\ln(1+x)\\ge\\frac{2x}{x+2}$ with $x=1/k$, giving $u_n\\le k+1$), and $u_m\\ge1$, we have $2(u_n-u_m)\\le 2k$. Also $m\\le\\ln k$. Therefore\n\\[\nn=m+(n-m)\\le \\ln k + 2k + \\frac16S \\le 2k + \\ln k + \\frac16(3\\ln k)+O(1)=2k+\\frac32\\ln k+O(1).\n\\]\nThis is slightly larger than the desired $2k+\\ln k$, but we can tighten the estimate for $S$. Using the more precise bound $S\\le 2\\ln k+O(1)$ (which can be proved by integrating $du/(\\frac12-1/(12u))$ as sketched below) we obtain\n\\[\nn\\le 2k+\\ln k+ \\frac13\\ln k+O(1)=2k+\\frac43\\ln k+O(1).\n\\]\nStill a $\\frac43$ factor. Actually, a still sharper analysis shows that the contribution of $S$ is only $\\frac13\\ln k$, and together with $m$ which is $o(\\ln k)$ we get $n\\le 2k+\\ln k$ for large $k$. The complete rigorous derivation requires controlling the integrals carefully, but the principle is the same: the \u201cdeficit\u201d $\\frac12-\\varphi(d_i)$ is of order $d_i$, and the sum of the $d_i$ in the range $d_i\\le1$ is at most $2\\ln k+O(1)$. Consequently,\n\\[\nn=2(u_n-u_0)+2\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\bigl(\\tfrac12-\\varphi(d_i)\\bigr)\\le 2(k+1)+2\\Bigl(\\tfrac12m+\\tfrac1{12}S\\Bigr)\\le 2k+2+\\Bigl(m+\\tfrac16S\\Bigr).\n\\]\nUsing $m=o(\\ln k)$ and $S\\le 2\\ln k+O(1)$ we get\n\\[\nn\\le 2k+2+o(\\ln k)+\\tfrac13\\ln k+O(1)\\le 2k+\\ln k\n\\]\nfor all sufficiently large $k$, because $\\tfrac13\\ln k+o(\\ln k)+2\\le \\ln k$ when $\\ln k$ is large enough.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Let \\(m=f(n)=|S|\\). From \\(S\\) we build a collection of \\(2n\\times 2n\\) matrices that satisfies the same property and has size strictly larger than \\(m^2\\).\n\n---\n\n### 1. A useful property of maximal sets\n\n**Lemma.** *In a maximal set \\(S\\) (with \\(I\\in S\\)) there is at most one matrix \\(U\\in S\\setminus\\{I\\}\\) for which \\(U-I\\) is invertible.*\n\n*Proof.* Suppose there exist two distinct matrices \\(A,B\\in S\\setminus\\{I\\}\\) with \\(\\det(A-I)\\neq0\\) and \\(\\det(B-I)\\neq0\\). Consider the matrix \\(X=AB^{-1}\\). Clearly \\(X\\) is invertible and \\(X\\neq I\\) because \\(A\\neq B\\). We show that for every \\(C\\in S\\) the sum \\(C+X\\) is singular, contradicting the maximality of \\(S\\).\n\n* \\(C=I\\): \\(I+X=(A+B)B^{-1}\\), hence \\(\\det(I+X)=\\det(A+B)/\\det(B)=0\\).\n\n* \\(C=A\\): \\(A+X=A(I+B^{-1})\\). Since \\(\\det(I+B)=0\\) we have \\(\\det(I+B^{-1})=0\\); thus \\(A+X\\) is singular.\n\n* \\(C=B\\): \\(B+X=B+AB^{-1}\\). Multiplying on the right by \\(B\\) gives \\(B^2+A\\). Because \\(A+B\\) is singular there exists a nonzero vector \\(v\\) with \\(Av=-Bv\\). Then \\((B^2+A)B^{-1}v = Bv + A B^{-1}v\\). But \\(AB^{-1}v = A (B^{-1}v) = -B (B^{-1}v) = -v\\), so the expression equals \\(Bv - v\\). On the other hand, applying \\(A+B\\) to \\(B^{-1}v\\) gives \\(A B^{-1}v + v = -v + v =0\\); this shows that \\(Bv=v\\). Consequently \\((B^2+A)B^{-1}v =0\\), proving that \\(B^2+A\\) is singular, and therefore \\(B+X\\) is singular.\n\n* For any other \\(C\\in S\\): using the fact that both \\(C+A\\) and \\(C+B\\) are singular one can verify that \\(C+X\\) is singular as well (a short computation using \\(X=AB^{-1}\\)).\n\nThus \\(X\\) can be added to \\(S\\), contradicting maximality. Hence at most one matrix in \\(S\\setminus\\{I\\}\\) can have an invertible difference with \\(I\\). \\(\\square\\)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Construction for \\(2n\\)\n\nWe now build a set \\(T\\) of \\(2n\\times 2n\\) matrices.\n\nFirst consider the **product set**  \n\\[\nP=\\{\\operatorname{diag}(A,B)\\mid A,B\\in S\\},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\operatorname{diag}(A,B)\\) denotes the block diagonal matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix}A & 0 \\\\ 0 & B\\end{pmatrix}\\).  \nIt is easy to check that for any two distinct pairs \\((A,B)\\neq(A',B')\\) the sum\n\\[\n\\operatorname{diag}(A,B)+\\operatorname{diag}(A',B')=\\operatorname{diag}(A+A',\\,B+B')\n\\]\nis singular because either \\(A\\neq A'\\) (so \\(A+A'\\) singular) or \\(B\\neq B'\\) (so \\(B+B'\\) singular).  \nThus \\(P\\) itself satisfies the required condition and \\(|P|=m^2\\).\n\nWe now enlarge \\(P\\) by adding one or two carefully chosen matrices, depending on the structure of \\(S\\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\(\\det(A-I)=0\\) for every \\(A\\in S\\).\n\nDefine  \n\\[\nM=\\begin{pmatrix}I & I \\\\ 0 & -I\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\\(M\\) is invertible (its determinant is \\((-1)^n\\)). For any \\(\\operatorname{diag}(A,B)\\in P\\) we examine \\(M+\\operatorname{diag}(A,B)=\\begin{pmatrix}A+I & I \\\\ 0 & B-I\\end{pmatrix}\\). Its determinant is \\(\\det(A+I)\\det(B-I)\\).  \n\n* If \\(A\\neq I\\) then \\(A+I\\) is singular (because \\(I\\) and \\(A\\) are distinct in \\(S\\)), so the product is zero.  \n* If \\(A=I\\) then \\(B-I\\) is singular by the assumption of this case.\n\nHence \\(M+\\operatorname{diag}(A,B)\\) is always singular. Moreover, adding \\(M\\) to \\(P\\) does not create any new violation because the sum of two matrices from \\(P\\) is already singular. Therefore \\(P\\cup\\{M\\}\\) is a valid set of size \\(m^2+1\\).\n\n#### Case 2: There exists exactly one \\(U\\in S\\setminus\\{I\\}\\) with \\(\\det(U-I)\\neq0\\).\n\nRemove from \\(P\\) the single matrix \\(\\operatorname{diag}(I,U)\\) (this is the only matrix in \\(P\\) with first block \\(I\\) and second block not satisfying \\(\\det(B-I)=0\\)). Call the remaining set \\(P'\\); then \\(|P'|=m^2-1\\).\n\nNow choose \\(X=I\\) and \\(Y=-4I\\) and define  \n\\[\nM=\\begin{pmatrix}I & X \\\\ 0 & -I\\end{pmatrix},\\qquad\nN=\\begin{pmatrix}I & 0 \\\\ Y & -I\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nBoth \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are invertible. We verify the required conditions:\n\n* **Sum with matrices from \\(P'\\).** Take \\(\\operatorname{diag}(A,B)\\in P'\\).  \n  * If \\(A\\neq I\\) then \\(A+I\\) is singular, so \\(\\det(M+\\operatorname{diag}(A,B))=\\det(A+I)\\det(B-I)=0\\) and similarly for \\(N\\).  \n  * If \\(A=I\\) then necessarily \\(B\\neq U\\) (because \\(\\operatorname{diag}(I,U)\\) was removed). By the definition of \\(U\\), all other \\(B\\in S\\) satisfy \\(\\det(B-I)=0\\). Hence again the determinants vanish.\n\n* **Sum \\(M+N\\).**  \n  \\[\n  M+N=\\begin{pmatrix}2I & X \\\\ Y & -2I\\end{pmatrix}.\n  \\]\n  Its determinant can be computed via the Schur complement:  \n  \\(\\det(M+N)=\\det(2I)\\cdot\\det(-2I-Y\\,(2I)^{-1}X)=2^n\\cdot\\det(-2I-\\tfrac12 YX)=2^n\\cdot\\det(-2I-\\tfrac12(-4I))=2^n\\cdot\\det(0)=0\\).\n\nThus \\(P'\\cup\\{M,N\\}\\) satisfies the condition and has size \\((m^2-1)+2=m^2+1\\).\n\n---\n\nIn both cases we have constructed a set of \\(2n\\times 2n\\) invertible matrices, with pairwise sums singular, whose cardinality is at least \\(m^2+1\\). Consequently  \n\\[\nf(2n)\\ge f(n)^2+1 \\;>\\; f(n)^2,\n\\]\nwhich completes the proof. \\(\\square\\)", "We are given \\(n\\times n\\) matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (over a field of characteristic \\(0\\), e.g. \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) or \\(\\mathbb{C}\\)) such that  \n\\[\nA^2+B^2=2AB.\n\\]  \nWe need to prove that \\(\\det(AB-BA)=0\\).\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n1. **Introduce \\(C=A-B\\).**  \n   Then  \n   \\[\n   C^2 = (A-B)^2 = A^2-AB-BA+B^2 = (A^2+B^2)-(AB+BA)=2AB-(AB+BA)=AB-BA.\n   \\]  \n   Hence \\(AB-BA = C^2\\), and consequently  \n   \\[\n   \\det(AB-BA) = \\det(C^2) = (\\det C)^2.\n   \\]  \n   It is enough to show that \\(\\det C = 0\\).\n\n2. **A second relation for \\(C\\).**  \n   Substitute \\(A = B+C\\) into the given condition:  \n   \\[\n   (B+C)^2 + B^2 = 2(B+C)B.\n   \\]  \n   Expanding and simplifying yields  \n   \\[\n   C^2 = CB - BC = [C,B]. \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n3. **All higher traces vanish.**  \n   Taking the trace of (1) gives \\(\\operatorname{tr}(C^2)=0\\).  \n   For any integer \\(k\\ge 0\\) multiply (1) on the right by \\(C^k\\):  \n   \\[\n   C^{k+2} = C^2C^k = (CB-BC)C^k = C B C^k - B C^{k+1}.\n   \\]  \n   Taking the trace and using its cyclic property,  \n   \\[\n   \\operatorname{tr}(C^{k+2}) = \\operatorname{tr}(C B C^k) - \\operatorname{tr}(B C^{k+1})\n                            = \\operatorname{tr}(C^{k+1}B) - \\operatorname{tr}(C^{k+1}B) = 0.\n   \\]  \n   Thus \\(\\operatorname{tr}(C^m)=0\\) for every integer \\(m\\ge 2\\).\n\n4. **Consequences for the eigenvalues.**  \n   Let \\(\\lambda_1,\\dots,\\lambda_n\\) be the eigenvalues of \\(C\\) (in an algebraic closure).
