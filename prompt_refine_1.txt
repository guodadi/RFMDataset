You will be required to solve a mathematical proof problem with the following requirements:  

1. If the problem specifies the knowledge scope or restrictions, you must endeavor to meet these requirements.  
2. Every step of your final proof process must be completely rigorous and in line with mathematical principles. It should not be a vague argument that relies on intuition, diagrams, or the word "obvious" instead of rigorous justification.  
3. When using non-trivial mathematical theorems, you must prove them based on basic knowledge rather than using them directly.

Then problem is:
{problem}
