The recurrence \\(S_n = (k+1)^n + k \\sum_{j=2}^n (k+1)^{n-j} U_{j-1}(P_j)\\) is correctly derived, and the argument hinges on the claim that \\(U_{j-1}(P_j) \\geq (k+1)^{j-1}\\) for all \\(j \\geq 2\\). If true, this implies \\(S_n \\geq (k+1)^n + k(n-1)(k+1)^{n-1}\\), leading to the average \\((k+1)^{G(\\Omega)}\\) exceeding \\(kn\\), proving existence.\n\nHowever, the proof of \\(U_{j-1}(P_j) \\geq (k+1)^{j-1}\\) is flawed.

For example, if \\(P_{j-1} = 1\\) and \\(P_j = (j-1)k + 1\\) with \\(j \\geq 3\\) and \\(k \\geq 1\\), then \\(P_j - k = (j-2)k + 1 > 1\\), so \\(P_{j-1} \\notin I_j\\).
