The correct expansion includes an additional term \\(A(k+2)^{1-c}\\) and higher-order terms, which were omitted.

This mischaracterization undermines the boundedness argument for \\(U_k\\).\n\n3. **Unjustified Boundedness of \\(U_k\\)**:  \n   The inductive step \\(U_k \\leq 2^{k-k_0} U_{k_0}\\) (from \\(U_{k+1} \\leq 2U_k\\)) does not ensure boundedness.
